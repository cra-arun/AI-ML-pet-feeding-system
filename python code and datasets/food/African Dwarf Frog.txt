African dwarf frogs are carnivorous, so their diet should consist primarily of live or frozen foods.  Here's a breakdown of suitable options:

**Ideal Foods:**

* **Bloodworms (live or frozen):**  A staple and readily accepted food.  Offer in moderation as they are high in fat.
* **Daphnia (live or frozen):**  Excellent source of protein and a good size for ADF's.
* **Tubifex worms (live or frozen):** Another good protein source, but use sparingly due to potential parasite contamination if not sourced reliably.
* **Micro-worms:** Tiny worms ideal for very young frogs or as a supplementary food.
* **Brine shrimp (live or frozen):** A good supplement, offering variety.


**Foods to Avoid or Offer Sparingly:**

* **Reptile pellets:** Not nutritionally complete for ADFs and can cause digestive issues.
* **Fish flakes:** Too large and not the right nutritional profile.
* **Large amounts of bloodworms:**  As mentioned above, while good, they're high in fat and shouldn't make up the majority of their diet.
* **Any food that's too large:**  Your frog could choke.

**Feeding Frequency and Amount:**

* **Juveniles:** Feed small amounts 2-3 times a day.
* **Adults:** Feed small amounts once or twice a day.  They have small stomachs and can easily overeat.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Quality:** Buy high-quality, reputable brands of frozen foods to minimize the risk of parasites and ensure nutritional value.  If using live foods, quarantine them before introducing them to your frog's tank to avoid introducing diseases.
* **Portion Size:**  Only feed what your frog can consume in a few minutes. Uneaten food will pollute the water.
* **Variety:**  Offer a varied diet to ensure your frog receives a balanced range of nutrients.
* **Observe your frog:**  Adjust feeding frequency and amount based on your frog's appetite and body condition.  An overweight frog will appear bloated.


By providing a diverse, high-quality diet, you can ensure your African dwarf frog remains healthy and thrives.  Remember to always remove any uneaten food from the tank promptly.
