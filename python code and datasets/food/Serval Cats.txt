Servals are wild cats and their dietary needs are quite specific.  **They should NOT be fed a typical cat food diet.**  While some people keep them as pets (legally and ethically complex in many places), it's crucial to provide a diet that closely mimics their natural prey.  This requires significant time, effort, and expense.

A proper Serval diet consists primarily of:

* **Raw meat:** This forms the bulk of their diet.  Suitable options include:
    * **Rabbit:** A good primary source of protein.
    * **Chicken:** Should be offered, but not as the sole protein source.
    * **Mice:** A crucial component due to their size and the hunting instinct fulfillment.  Should be offered whole, including bones and organs.
    * **Small rodents:** Similar to mice, but offering variety is beneficial.
    * **Birds (occasionally):** In moderation and must be suitable sizes.

* **Organ meat:**  Essential for providing vital nutrients.  Include liver, kidney, heart, etc. in moderation.  Too much liver can be toxic.

* **Bones:**  Crucial for calcium and dental health.  Feeding whole prey items helps with this.

* **Small amounts of vegetables:** While not a staple, small amounts of suitable vegetables can be offered for added fiber and nutrients.  These should be finely chopped or pureed to avoid choking hazards.  Consult with a vet experienced with exotic animals on suitable choices and quantities.

**What NOT to feed a Serval:**

* **Dry commercial cat food:** Lacks the necessary nutrients and texture.  It's simply not appropriate.
* **Cooked bones:** These can splinter and cause serious internal injuries.
* **Large amounts of fat:**  Can lead to pancreatitis and obesity.
* **Chocolate, onions, grapes, raisins, etc.:** These are toxic to cats in general, and especially harmful to Servals.
* **Processed meats:**  High in salt and fat and lack nutritional value.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Veterinary Care:**  Finding a veterinarian experienced with exotic felines is absolutely essential. They can advise on appropriate food quantities and monitor the cat's health.
* **Ethical Considerations:**  Owning a Serval involves a significant commitment and responsibility.  Ensure you are prepared to provide the necessary space, enrichment, and care for its entire life, which can span 12-20 years.
* **Legal Restrictions:**  Owning a Serval is illegal or highly regulated in many areas.  Check your local laws and regulations before acquiring one.
