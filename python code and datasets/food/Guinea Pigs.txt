Guinea pigs need a diet primarily consisting of high-quality **grass hay**.  This should make up 70-80% of their daily intake.  Good choices include timothy hay, orchard grass, and meadow hay.  Avoid alfalfa hay, as it's too high in calcium for adult guinea pigs.

The remaining 20-30% should be a mix of:

* **Fresh vegetables:** Offer a variety of dark leafy greens like romaine lettuce (in moderation), kale, spinach (in moderation), parsley, cilantro, and bell peppers.  Introduce new vegetables slowly to avoid digestive upset.  Avoid iceberg lettuce and other high-water content vegetables, as they offer little nutritional value.  A good rule of thumb is to offer a cup or two of vegetables per day, depending on the size of your guinea pig.

* **Guinea pig pellets:**  These should be a small part of their diet, supplementing, not replacing, hay. Look for pellets that are specifically formulated for guinea pigs, with no added sugars or artificial colors.  A small handful per day is usually sufficient.

**Foods to avoid:**

* **Fruits:**  Fruits are high in sugar and should only be given as very occasional treats in tiny amounts.
* **Processed foods:**  Avoid giving guinea pigs human foods like bread, pasta, or sweets.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to guinea pigs.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to guinea pigs.
* **Onions and garlic:** Toxic to guinea pigs.
* **Potatoes:**  Toxic to guinea pigs.
* **Rhubarb:** Toxic to guinea pigs.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a heavy, stable water bottle or bowl.
* **Vitamin C:** Guinea pigs cannot produce their own Vitamin C, so it's crucial they get it from their diet.  Many commercial guinea pig pellets are supplemented with Vitamin C.
* **Grazing:**  Allow your guinea pig to graze on hay freely throughout the day.
* **Variety:**  A varied diet ensures your guinea pig gets all the nutrients it needs.
* **Portion control:** Overfeeding can lead to obesity and health problems.


Always consult with a veterinarian or experienced guinea pig breeder if you have any questions about your guinea pig's diet. They can offer personalized recommendations based on your pet's age, breed, and health status.
