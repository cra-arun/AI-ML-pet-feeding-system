American toads are insectivores, meaning their diet consists primarily of insects.  A varied diet is crucial for their health. Here's what you should feed your pet American toad:

**Suitable Foods:**

* **Crickets:** These are a staple.  Choose appropriately sized crickets for your toad â€“ smaller crickets for younger toads, and larger ones for adults.  Gut-load your crickets before feeding (feed them nutritious food like high-quality commercial cricket food or vegetables and fruits) to ensure your toad receives optimal nutrition.
* **Mealworms:** Offer these occasionally as a supplement, not a primary food source.  Mealworms are higher in fat than crickets, so overfeeding can lead to obesity.
* **Waxworms:**  These are very high in fat and should only be given as an *extremely* occasional treat.  Too many waxworms can cause digestive problems.
* **Other Insects:**  You can also offer small amounts of other insects like:
    * **Dubia roaches:** A good alternative to crickets, often easier to keep.
    * **Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL):** A nutritious and sustainable option.
    * **Butterworms:**  Like waxworms, these are high in fat and should be given sparingly.
* **Earthworms:** Occasionally, you can feed earthworms (ensure they are not treated with pesticides!).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Size:** Insects should be smaller than the widest part of your toad's head to prevent choking hazards.
* **Variety:** Offering a varied diet is essential for good health. Don't rely on just one type of insect.
* **Quantity:** Feed your toad the amount it can eat in about 15-20 minutes. Remove any uneaten food to prevent it from spoiling.  The amount will vary depending on the size and age of your toad.  Start with a few insects and adjust as needed.
* **Gut Loading:**  This is extremely important! Feed the insects nutritious food before offering them to your toad. This ensures the insects are packed with essential vitamins and minerals that your toad needs.
* **Supplementation:** You may need to supplement your toad's diet with calcium and vitamin D3 powder.  Lightly dust the insects with the supplement before feeding.  Follow the instructions on the supplement packaging carefully.
* **Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a shallow dish.  American toads can also absorb water through their skin.
* **Avoid:** Never feed wild-caught insects unless you are absolutely certain they haven't been exposed to pesticides or other harmful substances.  Avoid feeding insects from areas with potential pollution.


If you are unsure about any aspect of your toad's diet, consult with a veterinarian specializing in reptiles and amphibians or an experienced herpetologist.  They can provide personalized advice based on your toad's age, size, and health.
