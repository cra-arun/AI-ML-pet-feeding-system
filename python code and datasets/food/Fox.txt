Foxes are wild animals and should not be kept as pets.  Keeping a fox as a pet is illegal in many places, and it's incredibly difficult to provide them with the proper care they need to thrive.  They require a specialized diet, vast territories to roam, and complex social interactions that cannot be replicated in a typical home environment.

However, if you are involved in the rehabilitation or care of a fox under the supervision of a licensed wildlife rehabilitator, their diet will consist primarily of:

* **Meat:**  This is the cornerstone of a fox's diet.  This includes commercially available high-quality dog or cat food (look for those with a high meat content and low grains),  and supplemented with:
    * **Whole prey:**  This is the most ideal, providing essential nutrients and natural foraging behavior. This might include (depending on the species and size of fox and the situation): mice, rats, rabbits, birds (depending on the fox's size and species), and other small animals appropriate for their size.  **This MUST be sourced ethically and legally.**
    * **Organ meats:**  Liver, kidney, and heart provide important nutrients.
* **Commercial fox food:**  Some specialized breeders or wildlife rehabilitators may use commercially prepared fox food.
* **Fruits and vegetables:**  These are offered in smaller amounts and should be considered supplemental, not the main source of nutrition.  Examples include berries, apples (remove seeds and core), and carrots.


**Again, it is crucial to emphasize that feeding a fox is only appropriate under the guidance of a qualified wildlife rehabilitator. Attempting to care for a fox without the proper expertise and permits is unethical and potentially illegal.**  If you encounter a fox in need, contact your local wildlife rehabilitation center or animal control.
