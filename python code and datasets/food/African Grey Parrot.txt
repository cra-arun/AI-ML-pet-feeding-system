African Grey Parrots have very specific dietary needs.  They shouldn't be fed a seed-only diet, as that is highly inadequate and leads to health problems.  Their food should be a balanced mix of high-quality pellets, fresh fruits, vegetables, and the occasional treat.

Here's a breakdown of what to feed your African Grey Parrot:

**1. Pellets (70-75% of their diet):**

* **High-quality parrot pellets:**  These are the cornerstone of a healthy African Grey diet. Look for pellets that are specifically formulated for large parrots and contain a variety of nutrients.  Avoid pellets with artificial colors and flavors.  Reputable brands often undergo rigorous testing to ensure a balanced nutritional profile.  

* **Avoid Seed-based mixes:**  These are often high in fat and low in essential nutrients. They should only be given as an occasional treat, making up less than 10% of their diet.

**2. Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (20-25% of their diet):**

* **Variety is key:** Offer a wide array of fruits and vegetables to ensure a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals.
* **Good choices:**  Apples (without seeds), bananas (in moderation), berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries), broccoli, carrots, corn (kernels), cucumber, green beans, kale, mango (in moderation), papaya, peas, spinach (in moderation), sweet potatoes.
* **Prepare properly:** Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before serving.  Cut them into appropriately sized pieces to avoid choking hazards.
* **Avoid:** Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onions, garlic, rhubarb, and uncooked beans.  These are toxic to parrots.


**3. Occasional Treats (5% of their diet):**

* **Small amounts:** Treats should be given sparingly to avoid disrupting the balance of their diet.
* **Suitable options:** A small amount of cooked, unsalted pasta; a tiny bit of plain cooked brown rice; a small piece of unsalted, cooked chicken; a sprinkle of cooked sweet potato.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh Water:** Always provide access to fresh, clean water.
* **Portion Control:**  Adjust portions to maintain a healthy weight for your bird.  Overfeeding can lead to obesity and related health problems.
* **Variety:** Offer a different selection of fruits and vegetables daily to ensure your parrot receives a varied nutrient intake.
* **Nutrient Supplements:** In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend supplemental vitamins or minerals, depending on your bird's individual needs and blood test results.
* **Never feed anything not specifically recommended for birds.** Consult an avian veterinarian or an experienced avian specialist for any dietary concerns.


**Always consult with an avian veterinarian before making any significant changes to your parrot's diet.** They can provide personalized advice based on your bird's age, health, and individual needs.  An improper diet can significantly impact the health and lifespan of an African Grey Parrot.
