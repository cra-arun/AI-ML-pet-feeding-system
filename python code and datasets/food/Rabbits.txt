Rabbits need a diet primarily based on **high-quality grass hay**.  This should make up 80-90% of their daily intake.  Good choices include Timothy hay, orchard grass, and oat hay.  Avoid alfalfa hay, especially for adult rabbits, as it's too high in calcium and protein.

The remaining 10-20% should be a mix of:

* **Pellets:**  Choose a pellet specifically formulated for rabbits, with no added sugars or artificial colors.  The pellets should be limited to prevent obesity.  A good rule of thumb is to offer about Â¼ cup per 6 pounds of rabbit weight per day.

* **Fresh Vegetables:**  Offer a variety of dark, leafy greens in moderation.  Good options include:
    * Romaine lettuce (in moderation)
    * Spinach (in moderation, due to oxalates)
    * Kale
    * Parsley
    * Cilantro
    * Bell peppers (avoid red bell peppers in large quantities)
    * Broccoli (in small amounts)
    * Carrot tops
    * Cucumber

* **Fruits:** Offer fruits sparingly as treats only, as they are high in sugar.  A small piece (a couple of teaspoons) a couple of times a week is sufficient.  Good options include:
    * Strawberries
    * Blueberries
    * Bananas (in small amounts)
    * Apples (without seeds)


**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Alfalfa hay (for adult rabbits)**
* **Legumes (beans, peas, lentils)**
* **Meat and dairy products**
* **Processed foods (bread, crackers, cookies)**
* **Chocolate**
* **Iceberg lettuce**
* **Raw potatoes**
* **Onions and garlic**
* **Treats containing seeds, nuts, or dried fruits**


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a heavy bowl or sipper bottle.
* **Gradual changes:**  Introduce new foods gradually to avoid digestive upset.
* **Individual needs:**  The exact amount of food will depend on your rabbit's age, size, breed, and activity level. Consult with a veterinarian or a rabbit-savvy expert for personalized dietary advice.
* **Dental health:**  Hay is crucial for wearing down rabbit teeth.  Insufficient hay can lead to dental problems.


Providing a balanced and appropriate diet is vital for your rabbit's health and well-being.  If you have any concerns about your rabbit's diet, please consult with your veterinarian.
