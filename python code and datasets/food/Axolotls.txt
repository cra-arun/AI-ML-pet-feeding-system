Axolotls are carnivores, so their diet should consist primarily of live or frozen foods.  Here's a breakdown of suitable foods and important considerations:

**Suitable Foods:**

* **Bloodworms (Chironomus):** A staple food, readily available frozen or live.  However, should not be the *only* food source.  Over-reliance can lead to nutritional deficiencies.
* **Blackworms (Tubifex):**  Another popular choice, available frozen or live.  Similar to bloodworms, they should be part of a varied diet.
* **Daphnia:** Small crustaceans, a good source of nutrients.  Usually available frozen.
* **Mysis Shrimp:**  Small shrimp, also a good nutritional supplement.  Available frozen.
* **Earthworms (chopped):**  A good source of protein.  Must be gut-loaded (fed nutritious food before offering to the axolotl) and chopped into appropriately sized pieces to avoid choking hazards.
* **Commercial Axolotl Pellets:**  These are specifically formulated to meet the nutritional needs of axolotls.  A good option to supplement live foods, ensuring a balanced diet.  Choose high-quality pellets with minimal fillers.


**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Fish flakes or other foods intended for other animals:**  These often lack the necessary nutrients for axolotls and can be harmful.
* **Large pieces of food:** Axolotls have small mouths and can easily choke on large pieces of food.  Always chop earthworms and other large items into manageable sizes.
* **Overfeeding:** This is crucial! Overfeeding leads to water quality issues and health problems for your axolotl.  Follow feeding guidelines carefully.


**Feeding Frequency and Amount:**

* **Juveniles (under 6 months):** Feed twice daily, offering a small amount they can consume within a few minutes.
* **Adults (over 6 months):** Feed once or twice daily, again, a small amount they can eat quickly.  You should adjust the amount based on your axolotl's size and activity level.  A good rule of thumb is to offer an amount approximately the size of their head.
* **Observe your axolotl:** If food remains uneaten after a few minutes, reduce the amount next time.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut Loading:** If feeding live foods, it's crucial to gut-load them.  This means feeding the live food a nutritious diet before offering it to your axolotl, ensuring your axolotl receives maximum nutritional benefit.
* **Variety:**  A varied diet is essential for a healthy axolotl.  Don't rely on just one type of food.
* **Water Quality:**  Uneaten food will quickly foul the water.  Remove any uneaten food after a few minutes.  Maintain excellent water quality through regular water changes.
* **Observe your axolotl:**  Monitor their eating habits and overall health.  Any changes in appetite or behavior should be addressed promptly.

Always research reputable sources before making any decisions about your axolotl's diet.  If you have any concerns, consult with a veterinarian experienced with aquatic animals.
