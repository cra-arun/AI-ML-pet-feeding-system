Shih Tzus, like all dogs, need a balanced diet to stay healthy and happy.  Their food should be specifically formulated for small breeds, as they have different nutritional needs than larger dogs.  Here's a breakdown of what to consider:

**Key Nutritional Considerations:**

* **High-Quality Protein:**  Protein is essential for muscle development and overall health. Look for foods that list a named meat source (like chicken, lamb, or fish) as the first ingredient. Avoid "meat by-products" or vague terms.

* **Healthy Fats:**  Fats provide energy and contribute to a shiny coat. Look for sources like chicken fat or fish oil (Omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial for skin and coat).

* **Fiber:**  Fiber aids in digestion and prevents constipation.  Look for foods with ingredients like beet pulp or whole grains (in moderation).

* **Limited Fillers:**  Avoid foods with excessive fillers like corn, wheat, and soy, which offer little nutritional value. These can also be common allergens.

* **Age-Appropriate Formulation:**  Puppies, adults, and senior dogs have different nutritional requirements. Choose a food specifically formulated for their life stage.

* **Small Breed Specific:**  Small breed dog foods are formulated with smaller kibble sizes that are easier for Shih Tzus to chew and swallow. They also often have higher calorie density to meet their energy needs.

**Types of Food:**

* **Dry Kibble:** This is a convenient and cost-effective option.  Look for high-quality brands with clear ingredient lists.

* **Wet Food:** Can be used as a topper or a complete meal.  It's often more palatable, but it's usually more expensive and has a shorter shelf life.

* **Raw Food Diets (BARF):**  These diets consist of raw meat, bones, and vegetables.  They can be beneficial, but require careful planning and preparation to ensure a balanced diet and avoid bacterial contamination.  Consult with a veterinarian before switching to a raw food diet.

* **Homemade Diets:**  These require careful research and should be formulated by a veterinary nutritionist to ensure complete and balanced nutrition.


**Brands (Note: This is not an exhaustive list, and individual needs may vary):**

Many reputable brands offer small breed-specific food.  Research and read reviews before choosing a brand.  Some popular examples include (but are not limited to):

* Royal Canin (they have a Shih Tzu specific formula)
* Purina Pro Plan
* Hill's Science Diet
* Wellness
* Orijen


**Things to Avoid:**

* **Cheap Foods:**  Often contain excessive fillers and low-quality ingredients.
* **Foods with Artificial Colors, Flavors, and Preservatives:** These can be potential allergens or irritants.
* **Foods Containing Ingredients Your Dog is Allergic To:** Common allergens include corn, wheat, soy, beef, and dairy.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Portion Control:**  Follow the feeding guidelines on the food packaging, adjusting as needed based on your dog's activity level and body condition.  Overfeeding can lead to obesity.
* **Fresh Water:**  Always provide access to fresh, clean water.
* **Dental Hygiene:**  Shih Tzus are prone to dental problems.  Choose foods that help support dental health, and regularly brush their teeth.
* **Veterinary Consultations:**  Consult with your veterinarian about your Shih Tzu's dietary needs, especially if they have any health conditions.


Ultimately, the best food for your Shih Tzu will depend on their individual needs and preferences.  Experimentation may be necessary to find the best option.  Always transition gradually to a new food to avoid digestive upset.
