Hedgehogs are insectivores, meaning their diet should primarily consist of insects.  However, a complete and balanced diet also needs to include other components.  Avoid feeding them anything that isn't specifically formulated for hedgehogs or recommended by a vet experienced with exotic pets.

**Good food options:**

* **High-quality commercial hedgehog food:** This is the foundation of a good diet. Look for kibble that's specifically formulated for hedgehogs and lists insects as a primary ingredient.  Avoid foods with high fillers or artificial ingredients.

* **Insects:**  These are crucial!  Offer a variety, including:
    * **Mealworms:** A popular choice, but should be offered in moderation due to their high fat content.
    * **Crickets:** A good source of protein.  Ensure they're gut-loaded (fed nutritious food beforehand) for optimal nutritional value.
    * **Waxworms:** Occasional treats only, as they're very high in fat.
    * **Dubia roaches:**  A good, healthy option, readily available online or at reptile suppliers.

* **Fruits and vegetables:** Offer small amounts as treats, not staples.  Good options include:
    * **Blueberries:** A good source of antioxidants.
    * **Strawberries:**  Offer in moderation due to the sugar content.
    * **Melon (small pieces):**  Watermelon, cantaloupe, etc.
    * **Cooked sweet potato (small pieces):**  A source of fiber and vitamins.
    * **Green beans (cooked):**  A good source of fiber.

**Things to AVOID:**

* **Cat or dog food:**  These are not nutritionally balanced for hedgehogs.
* **Milk or dairy products:** Hedgehogs are lactose intolerant.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to hedgehogs.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to hedgehogs.
* **Onions and garlic:** Toxic to hedgehogs.
* **Raw meat:**  Risk of bacterial contamination.
* **Bread, pasta, rice:**  Low nutritional value and can contribute to obesity.
* **Processed sugary foods:**  Unhealthy and contribute to obesity and dental problems.
* **Grapes and raisins:** Toxic to hedgehogs.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Variety:**  Offer a variety of insects and small amounts of fruits and vegetables to ensure a balanced diet.
* **Portion Control:**  Hedgehogs are prone to obesity.  Feed them appropriate portions based on their weight and activity level.  Consult your vet for guidance.
* **Fresh Water:**  Always provide fresh, clean water.
* **Supplements:**  In some cases, your vet may recommend supplements, such as calcium.


It is crucial to consult with a veterinarian experienced in exotic animal care for specific dietary recommendations for your hedgehog.  They can help you create a balanced diet tailored to your pet's individual needs and health status.
