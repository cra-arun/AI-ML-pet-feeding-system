Canaries need a varied diet to thrive.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed your canary:

**Primary Food Source (70-80% of their diet):**

* **High-quality canary seed mix:** This is the foundation of their diet. Look for a mix that contains a variety of seeds like canary grass seed, niger seed, rapeseed, and white millet.  Avoid mixes with a lot of fillers like wheat or oats.  A good quality mix will have a higher proportion of canary grass seed.

**Supplementary Foods (20-30% of their diet):**

* **Vegetables:**  Small amounts of finely chopped vegetables offer essential nutrients.  Good options include:
    * Spinach (in moderation, as it contains oxalates)
    * Carrot (finely grated)
    * Broccoli (finely chopped)
    * Green beans (cooked and chopped)
    * Bell peppers (finely chopped)

* **Fruits:** Offer small amounts of soft fruits.  Good choices include:
    * Apple (without seeds)
    * Banana (in moderation, as it's high in sugar)
    * Berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
    * Grapes (cut into small pieces)

* **Sprouts:** These are excellent sources of nutrients. Alfalfa and other sprouts are good choices.

* **Egg food:**  A commercial egg food or a homemade version (hard-boiled egg mixed with finely grated vegetables) can be offered 2-3 times per week.  This provides protein.

* **Mineral supplement:** A cuttlebone or mineral block should always be available to provide calcium and other essential minerals.


**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Avocado:** Toxic to canaries.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to canaries.
* **Salt:** Harmful in large quantities.
* **Caffeine:** Harmful.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic.
* **Raw meat:** Can harbor harmful bacteria.
* **Dairy products:** Canaries are not able to digest dairy effectively.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water daily.
* **Variety:** Offer a variety of foods to ensure your canary gets a balanced diet.
* **Portion Control:**  Avoid overfeeding.  A small amount of food scattered throughout the day is generally preferable to large portions at once.
* **Cleanliness:** Clean food and water containers daily to prevent bacterial growth.
* **Consult a Vet:** If you have any concerns about your canary's diet or health, consult an avian veterinarian.


By following these guidelines, you can ensure your canary receives the nutrition it needs to live a long and healthy life. Remember, moderation and variety are key!
