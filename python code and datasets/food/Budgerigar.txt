Budgies need a varied diet to thrive.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed your budgie:

**Essentials:**

* **High-quality seed mix:** This should be the foundation of their diet, but *not* the majority. Look for mixes that are low in millet (as they tend to overeat it and neglect other nutrients) and contain a variety of seeds like canary seed, oats, and sunflower seeds (in moderation).  Avoid mixes with added colors or sugars.

* **Pellets:**  These are crucial for providing a balanced nutritional profile.  They should make up at least 50%, and ideally up to 75%, of your budgie's daily food intake. Look for brands formulated specifically for budgies and containing a variety of vitamins and minerals.  Introducing pellets can take time; gradually mix them in with the seeds.

**Important Supplements:**

* **Fresh vegetables:**  Offer a variety daily, including leafy greens like spinach, kale, and romaine lettuce (in moderation, as some can be high in oxalates); carrots; broccoli; and peppers.  Always wash thoroughly before serving.

* **Fruits:**  Offer small amounts of fruits like apples, berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries), and bananas.  Avoid citrus fruits.

* **Sprouts:**  These are highly nutritious and a great source of vitamins and minerals.

* **Greens:**  Offer fresh sprigs of herbs such as parsley, dill, and cilantro.

**Things to Avoid:**

* **Avocado:** Toxic to budgies.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to budgies.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to budgies.
* **Caffeine:** Toxic to budgies.
* **Salty foods:** Harmful to their kidneys.
* **Processed foods:** Offer no nutritional value.
* **Millet spray:** Only as an occasional treat.  It's high in carbohydrates and low in nutrition.
* **Large amounts of sunflower seeds:** High in fat and can lead to obesity.


**Feeding Schedule:**

* Offer fresh food daily. Remove any uneaten food after a few hours to prevent spoilage.
* Provide fresh water daily in a clean water dish.
* Pellets should be available at all times.
* Seeds should be offered in a controlled amount, particularly if your budgie tends to overeat millet.


**Important Note:**  A balanced diet is essential for a healthy budgie. Consult with an avian veterinarian for advice on the best diet for your specific bird, especially if you have concerns about their health or weight.  They can also help you determine the appropriate portion sizes for your budgie's age, size, and activity level.
