Poison dart frogs (or more accurately, poison *arrow* frogs, as they were historically used to poison darts) in captivity **do not** eat poisonous insects.  Their toxicity, if any, comes from the insects they *would* consume in the wild.  In captivity, that toxicity is absent because their diet is different.

The diet of captive poison dart frogs consists primarily of:

* **Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies):** These are the staple food for most species.  Various sizes are available, from small "melanogaster" to larger "hydei" and "reducta."  Breeders often raise their own fruit flies to ensure a consistent supply.
* **Springtails (Collembola):** Tiny, wingless insects that are a good supplementary food source, especially for smaller frogs or juveniles.
* **Pinhead crickets:**  Very small crickets, ideal for very young frogs or as an occasional supplement.  Be sure to gut-load them (feed them nutritious foods before feeding them to your frog) for optimal nutritional value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut Loading:**  It's crucial to gut-load all insect food items.  This means feeding the insects a nutritious diet (e.g., high-quality commercial insect food, fruits, vegetables) before offering them to your frog.  This ensures the frogs receive essential vitamins and minerals.
* **Variety:** Offering a varied diet is important for the health of your frogs.
* **Size:**  The size of the insects should be appropriate for the size of the frog.  Too large an insect can be dangerous.
* **Supplementation:**  Some breeders use vitamin and mineral dusts to supplement the diet, but this should be done carefully and not overdone, as an excess can be harmful.  Consult with a herpetologist or experienced breeder for advice on supplementation.
* **Cleanliness:**  Always ensure your feeder insects are healthy and free from pesticides or other contaminants.


Never feed wild-caught insects to your poison dart frog.  They may contain parasites or pesticides.  Always use captive-bred insects from a reputable source.  If unsure about any aspect of their care, consult with a veterinarian specializing in exotic animals or an experienced poison dart frog breeder.
