Lovebirds need a varied and nutritious diet to stay healthy and happy.  Their food should consist primarily of a high-quality seed mix, supplemented with fresh fruits, vegetables, and other healthy options.  Here's a breakdown:

**Essential Components:**

* **High-Quality Seed Mix:** This should be the base of their diet, but NOT the entirety. Look for a mix specifically formulated for lovebirds, with a lower percentage of sunflower seeds (they're high in fat and can lead to obesity).  A good mix will include millet, canary seed, oats, and small amounts of other seeds.  Avoid mixes with fillers like corn or colored pellets.

* **Pellets:**  Consider adding high-quality pellets designed for small parrots or lovebirds. Pellets provide a more balanced nutritional profile than seeds alone.  Introduce pellets gradually, as some lovebirds are initially hesitant to try them.

* **Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (daily):** This is crucial for providing essential vitamins and minerals.  Offer a variety to ensure a balanced intake.  Good choices include:
    * **Fruits:** Apples (remove seeds), berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), bananas (in moderation), melon (cantaloupe, honeydew), mango (small pieces)
    * **Vegetables:** Broccoli florets, carrots (shredded or sliced), bell peppers (various colors), spinach (in moderation), green beans, sweet potato (cooked)

* **Sprouts:** Sprouts are excellent sources of nutrients and are readily eaten by most lovebirds.  You can sprout seeds like alfalfa, mung beans, or lentils.

**Occasional Treats (in moderation):**

* **Cooked whole grains:** Small amounts of cooked brown rice, quinoa, or pasta can be offered.
* **Nuts:** A tiny amount of unsalted, shelled nuts like almonds or walnuts (very sparingly, as they're high in fat).
* **Plain cooked pasta**
* **Plain Yogurt (unsweetened)**

**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Avocado:** Toxic to birds.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to birds.
* **Caffeine:** Toxic to birds.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to birds.
* **Salt:**  Harmful in large amounts.
* **Uncooked beans:** Can contain toxins.
* **Rhubarb:** Toxic to birds.
* **Onions & Garlic:** Toxic to birds.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water daily.
* **Portion Control:**  Avoid overfeeding, especially with seeds and high-fat treats.  Obesity is a common problem in pet birds.
* **Variety:** Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables to ensure your lovebird gets a wide range of nutrients.
* **Introduction of new foods:** Introduce new foods gradually to avoid digestive upset.
* **Cut food into appropriate sizes:**  Make sure the food pieces are small enough for your lovebird to eat safely.

Consult with an avian veterinarian or an experienced bird breeder for personalized dietary advice specific to your lovebird's age, breed, and health condition.  They can help you create a balanced and appropriate diet plan.
