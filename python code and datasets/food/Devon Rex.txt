Devon Rex cats have sensitive digestive systems and a high metabolism, so their diet needs careful consideration.  Here's what you should know about feeding a Devon Rex:

**Key Considerations:**

* **High-Quality Ingredients:**  Look for cat food with named meat sources (e.g., chicken, turkey, salmon) listed as the first few ingredients. Avoid fillers like corn, wheat, and soy.
* **Protein Content:**  Devons need a diet rich in protein to support their active lifestyle and maintain muscle mass. Aim for a protein content of at least 30-40%, depending on the cat's age and activity level.
* **Fat Content:**  They also need a moderate amount of healthy fats for energy and a shiny coat.  However, excessive fat can lead to weight gain, so choose a food with a balanced fat content.
* **Grain-Free Options:** Many Devons do well on grain-free diets, as grains can sometimes cause digestive upset. However, this is not universally true, so observe your cat's reaction.
* **Digestibility:**  Choose foods that are highly digestible to minimize digestive problems. Look for foods that use easily digestible protein sources and ingredients that support gut health (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics).
* **Sensitive Stomach Considerations:** Some Devon Rex cats have sensitive stomachs. If your cat has digestive issues, consider foods specifically formulated for sensitive stomachs. Look for terms like "gentle," "sensitive," or "easy digestion" on the label.

**Types of Food:**

* **Dry Kibble:**  A convenient and cost-effective option, but ensure it's high-quality.
* **Wet Food (Canned or Pouches):** Higher in moisture content, which is beneficial for hydration, especially if your cat doesn't drink much water.  It's often more palatable for picky eaters.
* **Raw Food (Raw Diet):** This is a controversial option.  A raw diet can be very beneficial if done correctly, but requires careful preparation and sourcing to avoid bacterial contamination.  Consult your vet before starting a raw food diet.
* **Homemade Food:**  This can be a good option if you're knowledgeable about feline nutritional needs and can ensure a balanced diet.  However, veterinary guidance is highly recommended.

**Feeding Schedule:**

* Kittens require more frequent feedings than adult cats.
* Adult Devons can be fed once or twice a day, depending on their individual needs and the food you choose.  Follow the feeding guidelines on the food packaging, but always monitor your cat's weight and adjust the portion size as needed.

**Important Note:**  Always consult your veterinarian before making any significant changes to your Devon Rex's diet. They can help you choose the best food for your cat's individual needs and health conditions.  They can also advise you on portion sizes and monitor your cat's weight to ensure they are maintaining a healthy weight.
