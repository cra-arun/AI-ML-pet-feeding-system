Yorkshire Terriers, like all dogs, need a balanced diet to thrive.  Their small size means they need a food formulated for small breeds, which often has smaller kibble sizes to make it easier for them to eat and digest.  Here's a breakdown of what to consider when choosing food for your Yorkie:

**Key Considerations:**

* **Breed-Specific Food:** Look for dog food specifically formulated for small breeds or toy breeds. This usually means smaller kibble and a higher calorie density to meet their energy needs in smaller portions.

* **Life Stage:**  The nutritional requirements change with age.  Puppies need food higher in protein and fat for growth, while senior Yorkies benefit from formulations that support joint health and digestion.

* **Ingredients:**  Choose a food with high-quality protein sources (like chicken, lamb, or fish) listed as the first few ingredients.  Avoid foods with excessive fillers, artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. Look for foods with added essential fatty acids (like omega-3 and omega-6) for skin and coat health.

* **Calorie Content:** Yorkies are prone to obesity, so carefully monitor their food intake and adjust portions as needed to maintain a healthy weight.  Overfeeding can lead to serious health problems.

* **Dental Health:**  Small kibble can help with dental cleaning, but regular teeth brushing is still recommended. Some foods are designed to promote dental health.

* **Allergies:** Yorkies can be prone to allergies. If your Yorkie exhibits skin problems, digestive issues, or other allergic reactions, consult your veterinarian to determine the cause and find a suitable hypoallergenic diet.


**Types of Food:**

* **Dry Kibble:**  This is a convenient and affordable option, offering a good shelf life.  Choose high-quality kibble with a good balance of nutrients.

* **Wet Food:**  Wet food is often more palatable and can be helpful for picky eaters or senior dogs with dental issues.  Use it in moderation, as it's usually higher in calories and moisture content than dry kibble.

* **Raw Food Diets (Raw Food Diet (RFD):**  These diets consist of raw meat, bones, and vegetables. While some proponents believe this is a healthier option, there are potential risks associated with bacterial contamination, so careful preparation and sourcing are crucial.  Consult your veterinarian before starting your Yorkie on a raw food diet.


**What to Avoid:**

* **Foods high in fillers:** Corn, wheat, and soy can be less digestible and offer fewer nutritional benefits.
* **Artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives:** These can contribute to allergies and other health problems.
* **Chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, xylitol (artificial sweetener):** These are toxic to dogs.
* **Bones that splinter easily:**  Cooked bones can splinter and cause internal injuries.


**Recommendations:**

It's always best to consult with your veterinarian to determine the best food for your Yorkshire Terrier's specific needs, considering age, activity level, and any health conditions. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your dog's individual requirements.  Don't hesitate to ask them for suggestions on brands or types of food.  They may also be able to give you guidance on portion sizes.
