Chinchillas have very specific dietary needs.  Their diet should primarily consist of high-quality **timothy hay**.  This should make up 80-90% of their daily intake.  It's crucial for their digestive health and provides essential fiber.

In addition to hay, you can offer small amounts of chinchilla-specific pellets.  **Avoid pellets containing added sugars, artificial colors, or fillers.** Look for pellets with a high fiber content and minimal added ingredients.  Only give a small amount (about 1-2 tablespoons daily for an adult chinchilla), as too many pellets can lead to obesity and digestive issues.

**Treats should be given sparingly.**  These can include:

* **Small amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables:**  Offer only a tiny piece (no larger than a thumbnail) a few times a week. Good choices include rosehips, apple slices (without seeds), a small piece of pear, or a tiny bit of dandelion greens.  Introduce new fruits and vegetables slowly to monitor for any digestive upset.  Avoid citrus fruits.
* **Commercial chinchilla treats:**  Look for treats specifically formulated for chinchillas, and offer them in very small quantities.


**Foods to absolutely avoid:**

* **Alfalfa hay:** Too high in calcium and protein for adult chinchillas.  It's okay for babies.
* **Sugary foods:** Candy, cookies, bread, etc.  These are extremely harmful.
* **Processed foods:** Anything containing artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives.
* **Meat:** Chinchillas are herbivores.
* **Dairy products:**  Chinchillas can't digest dairy well.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to chinchillas.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to chinchillas.


Always provide fresh, clean water in a heavy, leak-proof bottle.  Never use a bowl as water can easily become contaminated.

It's important to consult with a veterinarian specializing in exotic animals or a knowledgeable chinchilla breeder for advice on the best diet for your chinchilla, especially if you have concerns about their health or weight. They can help you create a balanced and healthy meal plan tailored to your pet's specific needs.
