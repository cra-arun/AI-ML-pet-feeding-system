Pionus parrots need a varied diet to thrive.  A good diet should consist of:

* **High-quality parrot pellets:** This should form the base of their diet (approximately 50-60%). Look for pellets specifically formulated for parrots, not just generic birdseed mixes.  Pellets provide a balanced source of nutrients.

* **Fresh fruits and vegetables:**  Aim for a variety, offering about 30-40% of their daily intake.  Good options include:
    * **Fruits:** Apples (remove seeds), berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), bananas (in moderation), mango, papaya, kiwi, melon (cantaloupe, honeydew).  Avoid avocados and citrus fruits.
    * **Vegetables:**  Broccoli, carrots, bell peppers (all colors), spinach (in moderation), kale (in moderation), green beans, peas, sweet potatoes, corn (on the cob is great for chewing).

* **Healthy fats and protein (10-20%):**  These are essential for a healthy coat and overall well-being.  Options include:
    * **Nuts and seeds (in moderation):**  Small amounts of almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds (shelled).  These are high in fat, so don't overfeed.
    * **Cooked beans and lentils:** Provide a good source of protein.  Ensure they are thoroughly cooked and cooled before offering.
    * **Hard-boiled egg (occasionally):** A good source of protein, but should be offered sparingly.

**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Avocado:** Toxic to parrots.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to parrots.
* **Caffeine:** Toxic to parrots.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to parrots.
* **Salt:** In large quantities, it's harmful.
* **Uncooked beans:** Can cause digestive upset.
* **Rhubarb:** Toxic to parrots.
* **Onions and garlic:** Toxic to parrots.
* **Anything moldy or spoiled:** Obviously harmful.
* **Citrus fruits (in large quantities):** Can upset their stomach.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Variety is key:**  Offering a wide range of fruits, vegetables, and other healthy options prevents nutritional deficiencies and keeps your Pionus interested in their food.
* **Fresh water:** Always provide clean, fresh water in a clean dish.
* **Portion control:**  Avoid overfeeding, particularly with high-fat foods.
* **Introduce new foods gradually:**  Observe your Pionus for any signs of digestive upset after introducing a new food.
* **Consult an avian vet:**  They can provide personalized dietary advice based on your Pionus' age, health, and individual needs.


By following these guidelines, you can ensure your Pionus parrot receives the nutrition it needs to live a long and healthy life. Remember, a balanced and varied diet is crucial for their well-being.
