Bearded dragons are omnivores, meaning they need a diet that includes both plants and animals.  The exact ratio depends on the age of your dragon:

**Juveniles (under 1 year old):**  Need a higher proportion of insects (around 75-80%) to support their rapid growth.

**Adults (over 1 year old):**  Can have a more balanced diet, with insects making up around 50-60% and vegetables/fruits making up the rest.  However, even adults still need a significant amount of insects.


**Insects (Live):**  These should form the bulk of a young dragon's diet, and a significant portion of an adult's diet.  **Prioritize gut-loading your insects!**  This means feeding the insects nutritious food (like leafy greens) before feeding them to your dragon to ensure they are a good source of nutrients.

* **Good choices:** Crickets (most common and readily available), dubia roaches (cleaner, less likely to escape), hornworms (occasional treat, high in calcium), silkworms (occasional treat, high in calcium).
* **Avoid:** Wild-caught insects (risk of pesticides and parasites), locusts (too hard for baby dragons), mealworms (too much fat, feed sparingly).
* **Important:** Dust insects with a calcium and vitamin D3 supplement *before* feeding them to your dragon.  Follow the instructions on the supplement.


**Vegetables (Adults eat more of these than juveniles):**  These provide essential vitamins and fiber.  Offer a variety of options.

* **Good choices:** Collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, dandelion greens, escarole, romaine lettuce (in moderation), bell peppers, butternut squash, carrots (in moderation).
* **Avoid:** Spinach, iceberg lettuce (low nutritional value), and anything with oxalate, such as rhubarb.


**Fruits (Treats only, in very small quantities):**  Fruits are high in sugar and should only be given as an occasional treat.

* **Good choices:**  Mango, berries (in moderation), papaya (in moderation).
* **Avoid:**  Citrus fruits, avocados.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut Loading:**  This is crucial. It ensures the insects your beardie eats are packed with nutrients.
* **Supplementation:**  Dusting insects with calcium and vitamin D3 is essential for proper bone development and preventing metabolic bone disease (MBD).
* **Variety:**  Offer a diverse range of insects and vegetables to ensure your bearded dragon gets all the necessary nutrients.
* **Portion Size:**  Adjust the amount of food you give based on your dragon's age, size, and activity level.  Observe their eating habits and adjust accordingly.  They should eat until their belly is slightly plump, but not overly full.
* **Clean Water:**  Always provide fresh, clean water in a shallow dish.
* **Temperature Gradient:**  Ensure your bearded dragon's enclosure has a proper temperature gradient so they can regulate their body temperature effectively, which helps with digestion.

It's always a good idea to consult with a reptile veterinarian or experienced breeder before making significant changes to your bearded dragon's diet.  They can provide personalized recommendations based on your dragon's individual needs.
