Gerbils need a varied diet to stay healthy and happy.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed them:

**The foundation of their diet should be high-quality gerbil food:**

* **Commercial Gerbil Food:** This is crucial.  Look for a mix specifically formulated for gerbils, containing seeds, grains, pellets, and sometimes dried fruits and vegetables.  Avoid mixes with too much sugary treats.  The ingredients list should be clearly visible.  Reputable brands are a good starting point.

**Supplements to add variety (in moderation):**

* **Fresh Vegetables:** Offer small amounts of fresh vegetables daily. Good choices include:
    * Carrots (small pieces)
    * Broccoli florets (small pieces)
    * Cucumber (small pieces)
    * Green beans (small pieces)
    * Spinach (small amounts, high in oxalates)
    * Bell peppers (small pieces)

* **Fruits:** Offer small amounts of fruit a few times a week.  These are high in sugar, so limit them. Good choices include:
    * Apple slices (remove seeds and core)
    * Banana slices (small pieces)
    * Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)

* **Hay:** Timothy hay or other suitable grass hays are essential for their digestive system and teeth.  Provide a constant supply.

* **Treats (very sparingly):**  These should be used as *occasional* treats only, not a staple part of their diet.  Examples include:
    * Small pieces of plain, unsalted nuts (almonds, walnuts, etc.)
    * A tiny piece of dried fruit (avoid sugary ones)
    * Small amounts of cooked, plain pasta


**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Chocolate:** Toxic to gerbils.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to gerbils.
* **Onions and Garlic:** Toxic to gerbils.
* **Anything Salty, Sugary, or Spicy:** These are unhealthy and can make your gerbil sick.
* **Processed foods:**  Avoid human food like bread, chips, etc.
* **Raw potatoes:**  Contain solanine, which is toxic.
* **Large amounts of leafy greens:**  Can cause digestive upset.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a sipper bottle or heavy, non-tippable bowl.
* **Portion Control:**  Gerbils have small stomachs and are prone to obesity.  Avoid overfeeding.
* **Variety:** Offer a diverse range of foods to ensure they get all the necessary nutrients.
* **Cleanliness:** Remove uneaten fresh food daily to prevent spoilage and bacterial growth.
* **Introduction of New Foods:** Introduce new foods gradually to monitor for any digestive issues.


If you are unsure about a particular food, it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid it.  Always consult with a veterinarian specializing in exotic pets if you have any concerns about your gerbil's diet or health.
