Degus have specific dietary needs to stay healthy.  Their diet should primarily consist of high-quality, timothy-based hay, making up about 70% of their daily intake.  This provides essential fiber for their digestive system.

Here's a breakdown of a suitable Degu diet:

* **Timothy Hay (70%):**  The cornerstone of their diet.  Choose high-quality timothy hay that is green and fragrant, avoiding dusty or moldy hay.  Offer unlimited access.

* **Commercial Degu Food (20-25%):**  A good quality commercial pellet specifically formulated for degus is crucial.  These pellets contain a balanced mix of nutrients that hay alone cannot provide.  Avoid mixes with added sugars, seeds, or nuts.  Look for pellets with high fiber content and low protein and fat.

* **Vegetables (5-10%):**  Offer small amounts of fresh vegetables daily.  Good choices include:
    * **Dark leafy greens:**  Spinach (in moderation due to oxalates), kale, romaine lettuce (in moderation), dandelion greens.
    * **Other vegetables:**  Small amounts of carrot, broccoli, cucumber, bell peppers (in moderation).
    * **Fruits (very sparingly):**  Fruits are high in sugar and should be given only as an occasional treat in very small quantities. Examples include a tiny piece of apple or a few berries.

**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Seeds and nuts:** These are high in fat and can lead to obesity and health problems.
* **Sugary treats:**  Absolutely avoid sugary foods of any kind.
* **Fruits (in large quantities):**  Too much fruit can cause serious digestive problems.
* **Meat:**  Degus are herbivores and should not be given meat.
* **Bread, pasta, rice:** These are not suitable for degus.
* **Dairy:** Degus are lactose intolerant.
* **Processed foods:**  Anything processed is generally unsuitable.
* **Alfalfa hay:** Alfalfa is too high in calcium and protein for degus.  Timothy hay is the better choice.
* **Potatoes:** These are high in starch and should be avoided.
* **Avocado:**  Toxic to degus.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a sipper bottle or a heavy, non-tippable bowl.
* **Variety:** While timothy hay forms the base, offering a variety of safe vegetables helps ensure a balanced diet and prevents boredom.
* **Portion control:**  Overfeeding, especially with treats, can lead to obesity and related health issues.
* **Dental health:**  Chewing on hay is crucial for their dental health.  Provide branches from safe, untreated wood (such as apple or willow branches) for gnawing to keep their teeth trimmed.
* **Introduce new foods gradually:**  Introduce new foods slowly to avoid digestive upset.


It's always recommended to consult with a veterinarian experienced with exotic pets or a knowledgeable breeder before making significant changes to your degu's diet.  They can provide personalized advice based on your degu's age, health, and individual needs.
