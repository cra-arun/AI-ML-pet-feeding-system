Horned lizards are insectivores, meaning their diet consists entirely of insects.  Their preferred food sources vary depending on the species and size of the horned lizard, but generally include:

* **Ants:** These are a staple food for most horned lizard species.  Harvester ants are especially popular, but they should be offered in moderation as their exoskeletons can be hard to digest.
* **Other insects:**  This can include (but isn't limited to):
    * **Grasshoppers:**  A good source of protein.
    * **Beetles (mealworms, darkling beetles, etc.):**  These should be offered sparingly, as they are not as nutritious as ants and other insects and some can be difficult to digest and even harmful.  Avoid using beetles as the primary food source.
    * **Moths:**  A good supplementary food.
    * **Crickets:** Although readily available, crickets should be offered sparingly. They are less nutritious than ants and grasshoppers, and have a tendency to bite.
    * **Termites:** A good source of protein.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut Loading:**  Before feeding insects to your horned lizard, feed the insects nutritious food themselves (e.g., high-quality commercial insect food, leafy greens, and fruits). This ensures your lizard gets the best possible nutrition.
* **Variety:**  Offering a variety of insects is crucial for a balanced diet.
* **Size:** Insects should be appropriately sized for your lizard.  The insect should not be larger than the space between your lizard's eyes.
* **Supplementation:**  Some keepers dust insects with calcium and vitamin D3 powder to supplement the lizard's diet. Follow the instructions on the supplement product carefully.
* **Live Food Only:** Horned lizards are ambush predators; they will not eat dead insects.
* **Water:**  Provide a shallow dish of fresh water.


**What NOT to Feed:**

* **Wild-caught insects:**  Wild insects may carry parasites or pesticides.
* **Insects from pet stores that are not specifically bred for reptile food:** These may be contaminated with pesticides or other harmful substances.
* **Large insects:**  These can be difficult for the lizard to handle and may injure it.

**Always research the specific needs of your horned lizard species.**  Different species may have slightly different dietary preferences.  Consulting with a reptile veterinarian or experienced reptile keeper is highly recommended, especially if you are new to keeping horned lizards.
