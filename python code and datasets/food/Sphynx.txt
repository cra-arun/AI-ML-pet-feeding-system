Sphynx cats, despite their lack of fur, have similar nutritional needs to other cats.  However, their high metabolism and often-sensitive digestive systems require careful consideration when choosing food.  Here's a breakdown of what to look for:

**Key Considerations:**

* **High-quality protein:**  Sphynx cats need a diet rich in animal protein (like chicken, turkey, fish, or lamb) as their primary source of energy.  Avoid plant-based protein sources as the main ingredient.
* **Moderate fat content:**  They need fat for energy and healthy skin, but too much can lead to weight gain. Look for a moderate fat content, typically around 10-20% of the total calories.  Their lack of fur makes them more susceptible to temperature changes, so a slightly higher fat content might be beneficial in colder climates, but consult your vet.
* **Limited carbohydrates:**  Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning their bodies aren't designed to efficiently process large amounts of carbohydrates.  Choose foods with minimal carbohydrates.
* **High digestibility:**  Since some Sphynx cats have sensitive stomachs, a highly digestible food is crucial to prevent digestive upset. Look for ingredients that are easily broken down, and often this is indicated by the food manufacturer.
* **Essential nutrients:**  Ensure the food contains essential vitamins and minerals, including taurine (crucial for heart health), Vitamin A, and Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids for skin and coat health (even though they lack a coat, these are still important for their skin).
* **Age-appropriate formula:** Kittens require a higher calorie and protein diet than adult Sphynx cats. Senior Sphynx cats may need a lower calorie and higher fiber diet to maintain a healthy weight and support their digestive system.
* **No fillers:** Avoid foods with excessive fillers like corn, wheat, and soy, which can contribute to digestive issues and offer little nutritional value.

**Types of Food:**

* **Dry kibble:**  A convenient and cost-effective option, but ensure it's high-quality and meets the criteria above.  The added benefit of dry food is that the chewing motion can help maintain dental hygiene.
* **Wet food (canned or pate):**  Higher in moisture content, which can be beneficial for hydration, especially in warmer climates. Look for a balance of protein, fat, and moisture.
* **Raw food diets (BARF):**  These diets consist of raw meat, bones, and organs. While potentially highly nutritious, they require careful planning and preparation to ensure proper nutrient balance and to avoid bacterial contamination.  Consult your veterinarian before starting a raw food diet.

**What to Avoid:**

* **Low-quality foods with cheap fillers:**  These often contain insufficient nutrients and can lead to health problems.
* **Foods containing artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives:**  These can be irritating to sensitive digestive systems.
* **Foods high in carbohydrates:**  As previously mentioned, cats don't process carbohydrates efficiently.
* **Foods with by-products:**  These are low-quality ingredients with little nutritional value.

**Important Note:** The best food for your Sphynx cat will depend on their individual needs and preferences.  It's crucial to consult with your veterinarian to determine the most appropriate diet for your pet. They can help you choose a food that meets your cat's specific nutritional requirements and address any existing health concerns.  Don't hesitate to ask your vet about specific brands or food types.  They can often provide tailored recommendations.
