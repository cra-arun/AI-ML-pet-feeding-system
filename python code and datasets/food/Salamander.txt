The diet of a salamander depends heavily on its species and age.  There's no single answer, but here's a breakdown:

**For most terrestrial salamanders (like fire salamanders, axolotls, and some newts):**

* **Insects:** Crickets (various sizes depending on salamander size), mealworms, waxworms (occasionally, as a treat, as they are high in fat), dubia roaches.  Gut-loading insects with nutritious food (like high-quality vegetables and fruits) is crucial.
* **Other invertebrates:** Earthworms, small slugs (ensure they're pesticide-free!), and occasionally small snails.
* **Commercial food:** Some specialized salamander pellets are available, often supplementing, not replacing, live food.

**For aquatic salamanders (like axolotls):**

* **Specialized pellets:** Commercially available sinking pellets formulated for axolotls are usually the primary food source.
* **Bloodworms (occasionally):**  These should be a *supplement*, not a staple.  They're often offered as a treat, but shouldn't make up a significant portion of their diet.
* **Earthworms (occasionally):**  Can be given as a supplemental food source.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Size:**  The size of the food should be appropriate for the salamander's mouth.  Food that's too large can cause choking or stress.
* **Variety:**  Offer a varied diet to ensure your salamander receives all the necessary nutrients.
* **Frequency:**  Feeding frequency depends on the age and species.  Juveniles usually need to be fed daily or every other day, while adults may only need feeding every 2-3 days.  Observe your salamander's behavior and adjust as needed.
* **Gut Loading:**  This is vital.  Feed the insects you plan to give your salamander nutritious food before offering them to your pet.  This ensures your salamander receives a balanced diet through the insects.
* **Supplements:**  Some breeders recommend occasional calcium and vitamin supplements, especially for growing salamanders.  Always follow the instructions on any supplement you use.
* **Water Quality:** For aquatic salamanders, maintaining clean, properly filtered water is crucial.
* **Species Specific Needs:** Research your specific salamander species to learn about its unique dietary requirements.  Different species have different needs.

**What NOT to feed your salamander:**

* **Wild-caught insects:** These may contain pesticides or parasites.
* **Processed human foods:** These lack the necessary nutrients and can be harmful.
* **Large prey items:** These can cause stress or injury.
* **Excessive amounts of fat-rich foods:**  This can lead to obesity and other health problems.


Before acquiring any salamander, it's crucial to thoroughly research the specific care requirements of the species you're considering.  A vet specializing in exotic animals can also provide valuable advice.
