Wallabies are herbivores and their diet should mimic their natural grazing habits.  Providing a varied diet is crucial for their health.  Here's a breakdown of suitable foods:

**Base Diet (Should make up the majority of their food):**

* **Grass hay:**  This is the most important part of a wallaby's diet.  Good quality Timothy hay or orchard grass hay should be available at all times.  Avoid alfalfa hay, as it's too rich in protein and calcium for them.

**Supplementary Foods (Offer in moderation):**

* **Pellets:**  High-quality wallaby or rabbit pellets specifically formulated for their nutritional needs.  Follow the instructions on the packaging regarding the amount to feed.  Overfeeding pellets can lead to obesity and health problems.
* **Fresh Greens and Vegetables:**  Offer a variety of these in moderation.  Good options include:
    * **Dandelion greens:** A good source of nutrients.
    * **Carrot tops:**  A tasty treat, but limit the carrots themselves.
    * **Parsley:**  A good source of vitamins.
    * **Basil:** A healthy addition in small quantities.
    * **Clover:** A natural food source for wallabies.
    * **Other leafy greens:**  Spinach (in moderation), lettuce (in moderation, romaine is better than iceberg), etc.  Avoid overfeeding any one type of green.
* **Fruits:**  Offer very sparingly as treats.  Small amounts of berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries) or a tiny piece of apple or banana are acceptable occasionally.  Avoid grapes and avocados, which can be toxic.
* **Branches and Twigs:**  These can help with dental wear.  Offer safe, pesticide-free branches of trees like willow, apple, or mulberry.  Always supervise your wallaby to prevent choking.

**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Alfalfa hay:** Too rich.
* **Grapes and raisins:** Toxic.
* **Avocados:** Toxic.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic.
* **Processed foods:**  Anything with added sugars, salts, or preservatives.
* **Meat or dairy products:** Wallabies are herbivores.
* **Bread and pastries:** High in carbohydrates and low in nutrients.
* **Excessive amounts of fruits and vegetables:** These can cause digestive upset.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide fresh, clean water.
* **Portion control:**  Avoid overfeeding. Obesity is a serious problem in captive wallabies.
* **Dietary Variety:**  Offer a mix of hay, pellets, and greens to ensure balanced nutrition.
* **Veterinary Care:**  Consult with an exotic animal veterinarian experienced with wallabies to determine the best diet for your specific animal and to monitor their health.

**Disclaimer:**  This information is for general guidance only.  The specific dietary needs of a wallaby can vary depending on age, breed, and overall health.  Always consult with a veterinarian experienced with wallabies before making significant changes to your pet's diet.  Improper nutrition can lead to serious health issues.
