Rats need a varied diet to stay healthy and happy.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed your pet rat, and what to avoid:

**Good Food Choices:**

* **Rat pellets:** These are the foundation of a rat's diet.  Choose a high-quality pellet specifically formulated for rats, not mice or other rodents.  Look for pellets with a low sugar content and a good balance of protein, fiber, and vitamins.  Avoid those with added colors or artificial flavors.

* **Fresh vegetables:** Offer a variety of vegetables daily, including:
    * Broccoli
    * Carrots (in moderation, as they are high in sugar)
    * Cucumber
    * Green beans
    * Bell peppers
    * Spinach (in moderation, as it contains oxalates)
    * Zucchini

* **Fruits:** Offer fruits in moderation, as they are high in sugar.  Good options include:
    * Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
    * Banana (small amounts)
    * Apple (remove the seeds and core)
    * Melon (in moderation)

* **Protein sources:**  A small amount of protein is beneficial:
    * Cooked chicken or lean meat (in very small amounts, as a treat)
    * Hard-boiled eggs (in very small amounts, as a treat)
    * Plain yogurt (unsweetened)

* **Treats (in moderation):**
    * Small pieces of nuts (almonds, walnuts, peanuts - unsalted and unflavored)
    * Seeds (sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds - in small amounts)
    * Cooked pasta (plain)

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a sipper bottle or a heavy, spill-proof bowl.
* **Variety:** Offering a variety of foods helps ensure your rat gets all the nutrients it needs.
* **Portion control:** Rats are prone to obesity, so avoid overfeeding.  Follow the feeding guidelines on your rat pellets and limit treats.
* **Introduce new foods gradually:** To avoid digestive upset, introduce new foods slowly and observe your rat for any adverse reactions.
* **Cleanliness:** Remove uneaten food daily to prevent spoilage and bacterial growth.

**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Chocolate:** Toxic to rats.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to rats.
* **Onions and garlic:** Toxic to rats.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to rats.
* **Raw meat:** Can contain harmful bacteria.
* **Processed foods:** High in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.
* **Candy:** High in sugar and generally unhealthy.
* **Large quantities of seeds:**  High in fat.

**Consult your vet:**  It's always a good idea to consult with a veterinarian who specializes in exotic animals about your rat's diet, especially if you have any concerns about its health or weight.  They can provide tailored advice based on your rat's age, breed, and health status.
