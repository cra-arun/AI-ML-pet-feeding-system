Sugar gliders have very specific dietary needs.  Their diet should be a balance of protein, fruits, and vegetables, with **no single food making up more than 10% of their daily intake**.  Improper feeding can lead to serious health problems.  Here's a breakdown:

**Essential Components:**

* **Insects:** This is the cornerstone of a sugar glider diet.  Provide high-quality insect protein such as:
    * **Crickets:** Gut-loaded (fed nutritious food before feeding to the glider) are best.
    * **Mealworms:**  Use sparingly as they are high in fat.
    * **Dubia roaches:** A good, less fatty option than mealworms.
    * **Waxworms:** Only as an occasional treat, high in fat.
    * **Silkworms:**  Also an occasional treat, high in protein.

* **Commercial Sugar Glider Food:** This is crucial for providing a balanced diet.  Choose a high-quality, reputable brand that's specifically formulated for sugar gliders. Look for options with low filler ingredients.  These are often in pellet form.

* **Fruits and Vegetables (in moderation):**  These should comprise a smaller portion of their diet.  Good choices include:
    * **Fruits:**  Apples (without seeds), berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), papaya, mango (small amounts), kiwi.  Avoid citrus fruits.
    * **Vegetables:**  Carrots (small amounts), cooked sweet potato (small amounts), green beans (small amounts).


**What to Avoid:**

* **Chocolate:** Toxic to sugar gliders.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to sugar gliders.
* **Caffeine:** Toxic to sugar gliders.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to sugar gliders.
* **Onions and garlic:** Toxic to sugar gliders.
* **Dairy products:** Generally not well-digested.
* **Large amounts of sugary foods:** Can lead to serious health problems.
* **Raw meat:**  Risk of bacterial contamination.
* **Processed foods:**  Offer no nutritional value.


**Feeding Schedule:**

* Offer food twice daily, once at dusk and once in the morning.  They are primarily nocturnal.
* Make sure fresh water is always available.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut Loading Insects:**  This means feeding the insects a nutritious diet before offering them to your sugar glider.  This ensures the insects are a better source of nutrients for the glider.
* **Variety:** Offer a variety of fruits, vegetables, and insects to ensure a balanced diet.
* **Portion Control:**  Follow the feeding guidelines on commercial food and offer fruits and vegetables sparingly.  Obesity is a common problem in sugar gliders.
* **Veterinary Advice:**  Consult with an exotic animal veterinarian before making significant dietary changes or if you notice any health issues with your sugar glider. They can advise on the best diet for your individual pet's needs.
