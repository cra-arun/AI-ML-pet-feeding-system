Finches need a varied diet to thrive.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed your finch, focusing on proportions and important considerations:

**Essential Diet Components:**

* **Finch Seed Mix (50-60%):**  This should be a high-quality mix specifically formulated for finches, *not* a generic "birdseed" mix.  Look for mixes that contain a variety of small seeds like:
    * **Nyjer (thistle):** Excellent source of oil and energy.
    * **Millet (various types):**  A staple food source.  Avoid mixes that are *mostly* millet, as it's low in some nutrients.
    * **Canola:** A good source of fat and protein.
    * **Sunflower (small amounts):** High in fat, so offer sparingly to prevent obesity.
    * **Rape:**  Provides essential fatty acids.

* **Fruits and Vegetables (20-30%):**  Offer a variety daily, including:
    * **Leafy Greens:** Kale, spinach, dandelion greens (ensure they're pesticide-free).
    * **Other Vegetables:**  Shredded carrots, chopped bell peppers, cooked sweet potato (small amounts).
    * **Fruits:**  Small pieces of apple, banana, berries (avoid citrus fruits).  Always remove uneaten portions after a few hours to prevent spoilage.

* **Grit (Small Amount):**  Finches need grit to help grind their food in their gizzard.  Provide a small amount of finely ground grit in a separate dish.

* **Protein (10-20%):**  Important, especially for breeding finches.
    * **Cooked eggs (hard-boiled, small pieces):** A great source of protein.
    * **Mealworms (occasionally):**  Live or dried, but offer in moderation due to high fat content.
    * **Sprouting Seeds:**  A nutritious and easily digestible source of protein.


**Foods to Avoid:**

* **Avocado:** Toxic to birds.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to birds.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to birds.
* **Caffeine:** Toxic to birds.
* **Salt:**  Harmful in large amounts.
* **Raw beans:**  Contain toxins that can be harmful.
* **Large seeds:**  Finches can choke on them.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water daily.
* **Variety:** A varied diet is crucial for good health.  Offer different fruits, vegetables, and greens regularly.
* **Moderation:**  Avoid overfeeding, especially high-fat foods like sunflower seeds.
* **Portion Control:**  Provide only what your finch will eat in a day to prevent waste and spoilage.
* **Cleanliness:**  Clean food and water dishes daily to prevent bacterial growth.
* **Supervision:**  Always supervise your finch when introducing new foods to make sure it's not allergic.


**If you're unsure about what to feed your finch, consult with an avian veterinarian or a reputable bird breeder.** They can provide specific recommendations based on your finch's species, age, and health status.
