Bourke's Parakeets have specific dietary needs to stay healthy.  Their diet should consist primarily of high-quality seeds, supplemented with fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods.  **It's crucial to avoid foods toxic to birds.**

Here's a breakdown of a good diet for a Bourke's Parakeet:

**Seeds (the majority of their diet, around 60-70%):**

* **High-quality seed mix:**  Look for a mix specifically formulated for small parakeets or finches. Avoid mixes with too much sunflower seeds, as they are high in fat and can lead to obesity.  A good mix will contain millets (various types), canary seed, small amounts of niger seed, and possibly others.  A good quality seed mix is the foundation.
* **Sprouting seeds:** Sprouting seeds increases their nutritional value, making them easier to digest and providing additional vitamins and minerals.  Sprout millets, canary seed, and other seeds from your mix.

**Fruits and Vegetables (around 20-30%):**

Offer a variety of these daily, but in small quantities:

* **Vegetables:**  Dark leafy greens (e.g., spinach, kale, collard greens), carrots (shredded or sliced), broccoli florets (small pieces), green beans (cooked or raw), bell peppers (small pieces).
* **Fruits:**  Apples (small pieces, remove seeds and core), berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries â€“ in moderation), melon (small pieces).  **Avoid avocado, which is toxic to birds.**

**Other Nutritious Foods (small amounts):**

* **Cooked grains:**  Small amounts of cooked brown rice, quinoa, or millet can be offered occasionally.
* **Cooked eggs:**  Hard-boiled egg (small amount, once or twice a week).
* **Sprouted seeds:** As mentioned above, are a great addition.


**Things to AVOID:**

* **Avocado:**  Toxic to birds.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to birds.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to birds.
* **Caffeine:** Toxic to birds.
* **Salt:**  Excessive salt is harmful.
* **Processed foods:** Avoid anything processed, sugary, or salty.
* **Large amounts of sunflower seeds:** High in fat and can lead to obesity.
* **Rhubarb:** Toxic to birds.
* **Uncooked beans:** Contain toxins that are harmful.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide fresh, clean water daily.
* **Variety:** Offer a variety of foods to ensure a balanced diet.
* **Portion control:** Don't overfeed. Bourke's Parakeets are prone to obesity.
* **Cleanliness:** Remove uneaten food daily to prevent spoilage and bacterial growth.
* **Cut food into small pieces:**  To prevent choking hazards.
* **Introduce new foods gradually:**  Monitor your bird for any adverse reactions.


It's always best to consult with an avian veterinarian to create a diet plan specifically tailored to your Bourke's Parakeet's age, health, and individual needs. They can also advise on appropriate supplements if needed.
