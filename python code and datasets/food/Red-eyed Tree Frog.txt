Red-eyed Tree Frogs are arboreal, meaning they live in trees, and are insectivores.  Their diet in captivity should mimic this.  Here's a breakdown of appropriate foods:

**Best Foods:**

* **Crickets:**  A staple.  Choose appropriately sized crickets – too large can be dangerous.  Gut-load crickets before feeding (see below).  Dust with calcium and vitamin supplements (see below).
* **Mealworms:**  A good supplemental food, but not a primary source due to their high fat content.  Offer sparingly.
* **Waxworms:**  High in fat, use as an *occasional* treat only.  Too many can lead to obesity and health problems.
* **Dubia roaches:**  A great alternative to crickets, often preferred by frogs and easier to manage.
* **Fruit flies (Drosophila):** Excellent food, especially for smaller frogs or juveniles.  Use flightless varieties to prevent escapes.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut-loading:**  Before feeding insects to your frog, feed the insects nutritious food like high-quality greens, fruits, and vegetables for 24-48 hours. This ensures your frog gets the best possible nutrition.
* **Supplementation:**  Dust your insects with a calcium and vitamin D3 powder (specifically formulated for reptiles and amphibians) 1-2 times per week.  This prevents metabolic bone disease.  Avoid over-supplementation, as this can be harmful.
* **Size:**  Insects should be no larger than the space between your frog's eyes.  Larger prey can be dangerous.
* **Variety:**  Offering a variety of insects helps ensure your frog receives a balanced diet.
* **Frequency:**  Feeding frequency depends on the frog's age and size. Juveniles may need feeding daily, while adults can be fed every other day or even every few days.  Observe your frog's behavior – if it seems hungry, it's time to feed.
* **Water:**  Always provide fresh, clean water in a shallow dish.  Red-eyed Tree Frogs will drink from it and may even partially submerge themselves.

**Foods to Avoid:**

* **Wild-caught insects:**  These may carry parasites or pesticides.
* **Insects from treated lawns or gardens:**  Pesticides and herbicides can be toxic.


**In short:**  Focus on gut-loaded crickets and/or dubia roaches as the primary food source, supplemented with occasional mealworms and fruit flies.  Always dust with appropriate supplements, and monitor your frog's weight and health to ensure it's thriving.  If you have any concerns, consult a veterinarian specializing in reptiles and amphibians.
