Hyacinth Macaws are large, powerful birds with specific dietary needs.  Their diet should be varied and consist primarily of high-quality pellets formulated for large parrots, supplemented with fresh foods.  **Never rely solely on seeds.**  A seed-only diet is deficient and leads to serious health problems.

Here's a breakdown of what to feed a Hyacinth Macaw:

**Foundation (70-75%):**

* **High-quality parrot pellets:** These should be a large portion of their diet, providing a balanced mix of nutrients. Look for pellets specifically formulated for large parrots, such as Hyacinth Macaws.  Avoid small, low-quality pellets.  Brands like Zupreem, Harrison's, and Roudybush are generally well-regarded.

**Fresh Foods (25-30%):**  Variety is key here! Offer a mix of these, rotating options regularly:

* **Fruits:**  Apples (remove seeds), bananas (in moderation due to sugar content), berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), mangoes, papaya, peaches, pears.  Always remove pits and seeds.
* **Vegetables:**  Cooked sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli, green beans, squash, bell peppers (all colors).  Avoid avocados, which are toxic to birds.
* **Nuts and Seeds (in moderation):**  A small amount of walnuts, almonds (unsalted, unroasted), and sunflower seeds can be offered as treats, but not as a staple.  Too many can lead to obesity and nutritional imbalances.
* **Sprouts:**  These are a great source of nutrients.  You can sprout various seeds and legumes (alfalfa, mung beans).
* **Fortified Bird Biscuits:**  These can be a useful addition as part of a varied diet, providing additional nutrients.


**Things to AVOID:**

* **Avocado:**  Toxic to birds.
* **Chocolate:**  Toxic to birds.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to birds.
* **Caffeine:**  Toxic to birds.
* **Salt:**  Use unsalted foods.
* **Onions and garlic:**  Toxic to birds.
* **Processed foods:**  Avoid anything sugary, salty, or processed specifically designed for humans.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water daily.
* **Portion Control:**  Hyacinth Macaws are prone to obesity.  Monitor their weight and adjust food portions accordingly.
* **Variety:**  Offer a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and other approved foods to ensure they get a balanced diet.
* **Veterinary Care:**  Regular checkups with an avian veterinarian are crucial for monitoring your macaw's health and addressing any potential nutritional deficiencies.
