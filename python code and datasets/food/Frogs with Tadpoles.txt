The food you give your pet frog and tadpoles depends entirely on their stage of life and species.  **Never assume all frogs and tadpoles eat the same thing.**

**Tadpoles:**

* **Early stages (newly hatched):**  They need very fine particles.  Good options include:
    * **Algae:**  This is their natural diet.  You can cultivate algae in a separate container (a small shallow dish with some pond water and a bit of sunlight will do).
    * **Commercial tadpole food:**  Available at pet stores, specifically formulated for tadpoles.
    * **Finely crushed fish flakes:**  A very small amount, crushed to a near-powder consistency.
* **Later stages (as they grow):**  Their appetites increase and they'll need more substantial food:
    * **Commercial tadpole food:** Still a good option.
    * **Blanched lettuce or spinach:**  Small pieces.
    * **Cooked (and cooled) peas:**  A good source of fiber.
    * **Other finely chopped vegetables:**  Avoid anything with strong flavors or that might be toxic (like onion or garlic).

**Frogs (after metamorphosis):**  This depends entirely on the species of frog.  There are carnivorous, insectivorous, and herbivorous frogs.  **Research your specific frog species to determine its dietary needs.**  However, common food items for many species include:

* **Insects:** Crickets, mealworms, waxworms (in moderation, these are fatty), fruit flies (for smaller frogs), and other small insects.  **Gut-loading** your insects (feeding them nutritious food before feeding them to your frog) is crucial for optimal nutrition.
* **Other invertebrates:**  Depending on the frog species, you may be able to offer small earthworms, snails, or even bloodworms (again, in moderation).
* **Commercial frog food:**  Pellet or other forms of formulated frog food are available.
* **(Some species) Small amounts of appropriately sized live prey:** Small fish or pinky mice may be appropriate for larger frog species, but **only if that's a part of their natural diet**.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Variety:** Offer a varied diet to ensure your frogs and tadpoles receive all the necessary nutrients.
* **Quantity:** Feed only what they can eat within a few minutes. Remove any uneaten food to prevent water contamination.
* **Cleanliness:**  Keep their environment clean to prevent disease. Regularly remove uneaten food and frog waste.
* **Species identification:**  Knowing the exact species of your frog is crucial for determining the appropriate diet.  Improper feeding can lead to nutritional deficiencies or health problems.
* **Water quality:** Clean, dechlorinated water is vital for both tadpoles and frogs.


If you're unsure about what to feed your frogs or tadpoles, consult a reputable herpetologist or a specialist at a pet store that carries amphibians.  Don't rely solely on internet information without confirming it with a knowledgeable source.
