Eastern Newts ( *Notophthalmus viridescens*) are carnivorous, meaning their diet consists primarily of live animal matter.  Here's a breakdown of suitable foods:

**Best Foods:**

* **Small insects:**  This forms the bulk of their diet in the wild.  Good options include:
    * **Mealworms:** A staple, but should be offered sparingly as they're high in chitin, which is difficult to digest.  Offer them only occasionally, as a supplement to a more varied diet.
    * **Waxworms:** These are high in fat and should only be given as an occasional treat, not a regular food source.
    * **Crickets:**  A good option, but choose smaller sizes appropriate for the newt's size.  Gut-load your crickets before feeding them to the newt to ensure nutritional value.
    * **Fruit flies (Drosophila):** Excellent for smaller newts and juveniles.
    * **Springtails:**  Excellent source of food for smaller newts, especially juveniles.  They are easier to raise in captivity.
    * **Isopods (woodlice):**  Similar to springtails, another good option.
* **Other invertebrates:**
    * **Bloodworms (live or frozen, but thawed before feeding):** A convenient option, but should not be the sole food source.

**Less Ideal, But Can Be Used Sparingly:**

* **Earthworms (chopped):**  Only offer smaller pieces to avoid blockages.
* **Daphnia:** Small crustaceans that provide some nutritional value.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Size:**  Always choose food items that are smaller than the newt's head to prevent choking hazards.
* **Gut Loading:**  Before feeding insects to your newt, gut-load them by feeding them nutritious foods like high-quality commercial insect food, vegetables, and fruits for 24-48 hours. This ensures your newt receives better nutrition.
* **Variety:**  Offering a varied diet is crucial for maintaining the health of your Eastern Newt.  Avoid feeding the same food item exclusively.
* **Frequency:**  Feed juveniles daily or every other day. Adults can be fed every 2-3 days, or even less frequently depending on their appetite and size.  Observe your newt to gauge how much they are eating.  Remove any uneaten food promptly.
* **Supplementation:**  While a varied diet generally provides sufficient nutrients, you might consider a vitamin/mineral supplement specifically formulated for amphibians, sprinkled occasionally on the food. However, it's best to consult a veterinarian or herpetologist for advice on supplementation.
* **Avoid:**  Never feed your Eastern Newt anything from the wild unless you are absolutely certain it is safe and free from pesticides or parasites.

Always research and ensure you understand the specific needs of your pet. If you are unsure about anything, consult with a veterinarian experienced in reptile and amphibian care.
