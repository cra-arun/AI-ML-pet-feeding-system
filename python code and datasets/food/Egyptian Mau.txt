Egyptian Maus, like all cats, need a high-quality diet to thrive.  There's no single "best" food, as individual needs vary depending on age, activity level, and any health conditions. However, here's a guide to choosing appropriate food for your Egyptian Mau:

**Key Considerations:**

* **Age:** Kittens need kitten food formulated with higher protein and fat content for growth. Adult Maus need food tailored to their mature metabolism. Senior Maus might benefit from food designed for their age, often with joint support ingredients.
* **Activity Level:** A more active Mau will require more calories than a less active one.
* **Health Conditions:**  If your Mau has allergies, sensitivities, or specific health issues (like kidney disease), you'll need a veterinary-recommended diet.
* **Ingredients:** Look for foods with high-quality animal protein as the primary ingredient (e.g., chicken, turkey, fish). Avoid foods with excessive fillers like corn, wheat, and soy, as these can be less digestible and may cause allergies.  Check for named meat sources – “meat by-products” is less specific and may contain lower quality ingredients.

**Food Types:**

* **Dry Kibble:** Convenient and affordable, but may not be as palatable as wet food and can contribute to dehydration if not enough water is consumed.
* **Wet Food (Canned or Pouches):** Higher in moisture content, which is beneficial for hydration. Often more appealing to cats, but can be more expensive.
* **Raw Food Diets (Raw meat, bones, organs):** Requires careful sourcing and preparation to avoid bacterial contamination.  Consult with your vet before starting a raw diet.
* **Commercial Brands:** Many reputable brands offer cat food formulated for different life stages and needs.  Some popular brands include Wellness, Orijen, Royal Canin (they have a breed-specific line), Blue Buffalo, and Instinct.  Research different brands and read reviews before choosing one.

**What to Look For on the Label:**

* **High protein content:**  Cats are obligate carnivores and need a protein-rich diet.
* **Moderate fat content:**  Fat provides energy and essential fatty acids.
* **Named meat sources:**  Avoid vague terms like "meat by-products."
* **Limited fillers:**  Minimize ingredients like corn, wheat, and soy.
* **Added taurine:**  This amino acid is essential for cats' heart and eye health.

**Important Note:** Always consult with your veterinarian before making significant changes to your cat's diet, especially if your Mau has any pre-existing health conditions. They can help you determine the best food based on your cat's individual needs and recommend appropriate portion sizes.  Sudden diet changes can cause digestive upset.
