Quaker parrots need a varied diet to thrive.  A good diet should consist of:

* **High-quality pellet food (70-75% of their diet):**  This forms the base of their nutrition and should be a formulated mix specifically designed for parrots. Look for brands with minimal artificial colors and flavors.  Avoid mixes with a lot of seeds as the primary ingredient.

* **Fresh fruits and vegetables (20-25% of their diet):**  Offer a wide variety to ensure a good balance of nutrients.  Good choices include:

    * **Fruits:** Apples (remove seeds), berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), bananas (in moderation), mango, papaya, kiwi, oranges (in moderation due to acidity).
    * **Vegetables:** Broccoli, carrots, spinach (in moderation), bell peppers, peas, green beans, sweet potatoes, squash.

* **Healthy fats (5% of their diet):** These are important for feather health and overall well-being.  Offer sparingly:

    * **Small amounts of nuts:**  Walnuts, almonds (unsalted and unflavored), pecans (in moderation).
    * **Seeds:**  Sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds (as treats, not a staple).

**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Avocado:** Toxic to birds.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to birds.
* **Caffeine:** Toxic to birds.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to birds.
* **Salt:** Too much salt is harmful.
* **Anything processed or containing artificial sweeteners/colors/flavorings:** Limit these as much as possible.
* **Uncooked beans:**  Contain toxins that are harmful to birds.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Variety:** Offer a different combination of fruits and vegetables daily to prevent nutritional deficiencies.
* **Freshness:** Always provide fresh food and remove any uneaten portions after a few hours to prevent spoilage.
* **Cleanliness:** Ensure your parrot's food and water dishes are clean to prevent bacterial growth.
* **Portion control:**  Overfeeding can lead to obesity and health problems.
* **Supplements:**  In some cases, a veterinarian might recommend supplements, but this should be done only under their guidance.
* **Introduce new foods gradually:** Introduce new foods one at a time to monitor for any allergic reactions.


It's always best to consult with an avian veterinarian to create a diet plan that's specifically tailored to your Quaker parrot's individual needs and age. They can provide guidance on the appropriate amount of food to offer based on your bird's size and activity level.
