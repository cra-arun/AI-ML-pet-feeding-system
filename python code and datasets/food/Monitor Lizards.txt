The diet of a monitor lizard depends heavily on its species and age.  There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and **improper feeding can lead to serious health problems or even death.**  Always research the specific dietary needs of your *particular* monitor lizard species.

That said, here's a general overview:

**Juveniles (young monitors):**  Need a higher proportion of insects and smaller prey items to support their rapid growth.

* **Insects:** Crickets, mealworms, roaches (dubia roaches are a popular choice), superworms (in moderation), waxworms (as an occasional treat only).  These should be gut-loaded (fed nutritious food) before being offered to the lizard.
* **Pinkies/Fuzzy Mice:**  Very small mice, appropriate for the size of the juvenile.  Frequency should be determined based on the lizard's size and growth rate.
* **Other small prey:** Small lizards (depending on legality and availability), appropriately sized fish.


**Adults (mature monitors):**  Can handle larger prey items and a more diverse diet.  However, the balance is still crucial.

* **Larger prey:**  Mice, rats (size appropriate), chicks, quail, rabbits (size appropriate).  The frequency depends on the size of the prey and the monitor's size.
* **Other protein sources:**  Whole fish (boneless), cooked eggs (occasionally), commercially available reptile diets (supplements ONLY, not as the primary diet).


**Important Considerations:**

* **Variety:**  A diverse diet is essential to prevent nutritional deficiencies.
* **Size of prey:** Prey items should be roughly the size of the lizard's head (or slightly smaller). Larger prey can lead to choking or digestive issues.
* **Gut loading:**  Always gut-load insects with nutritious food to ensure your lizard gets essential vitamins and minerals.
* **Supplementation:**  Calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation is usually necessary, especially for juveniles.  The specific type and amount of supplements should be determined by a veterinarian experienced with reptiles.
* **Bone:**  Some monitor lizards need a certain amount of bone in their diet for calcium absorption.  Whole prey items (mice, rats, etc.) generally provide this.  Avoid giving only commercially processed foods that lack natural bone structure.
* **Frequency:**  Feeding frequency depends on the age and size of the lizard, and the size of the prey.  Some species eat daily, others less frequently.
* **Water:**  Always provide fresh, clean water.
* **Veterinary care:**  Regular veterinary check-ups are essential to monitor the health of your monitor lizard and ensure its dietary needs are being met.


**Absolutely Avoid:**

* **Raw poultry or meat from unknown sources:**  High risk of bacterial contamination.
* **Cat or dog food:**  Not nutritionally complete for monitor lizards.
* **Excessive amounts of fat or sugary foods:**  Can lead to obesity and health problems.


**Before acquiring ANY monitor lizard, thoroughly research the specific species you are considering. Their dietary needs vary greatly.**  Consulting with a reptile veterinarian and experienced reptile keepers is crucial for ensuring the health and well-being of your pet.  Failure to do so can lead to serious health issues and a shortened lifespan.
