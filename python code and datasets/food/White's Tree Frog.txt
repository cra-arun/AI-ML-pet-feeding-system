White's Tree Frogs (also known as Dumpy Frogs) are insectivores, meaning their diet consists entirely of insects.  Here's a breakdown of suitable foods:

**Best Foods:**

* **Crickets:**  A staple food source.  Offer various sizes depending on the frog's size.  Gut-load crickets before feeding (more on this below).
* **Mealworms:**  A good supplementary food, but shouldn't be the primary food source as they are high in fat. Offer sparingly.
* **Waxworms:**  High in fat, only offer as an occasional treat in small amounts.  Too many can lead to obesity and health problems.
* **Dubia Roaches:** A very good, readily accepted food source, and are relatively easy to culture.  Often preferred over crickets.
* **Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL):** Excellent source of nutrition, readily accepted, and relatively easy to source.  Can be a main stay of the diet.

**Less Ideal (but can be included occasionally):**

* **Fruit Flies (Drosophila):** Good for very young froglets.  Larger frogs may not find them appealing enough.
* **Butterworms:** High in fat, use sparingly as an occasional treat only.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut-loading:** Before feeding insects to your frog, feed the insects nutritious food like high-quality cricket food, vegetables (e.g., carrots, sweet potatoes), and fruits (e.g., apples, oranges) for at least 24 hours.  This ensures the insects are packed with essential nutrients that your frog will then receive.
* **Dusting with Supplements:**  Regularly dust your insects with a calcium and vitamin D3 powder.  This is crucial for your frog's bone health and overall well-being.  You can find these supplements at pet stores.  The frequency of dusting depends on the age and health of the frog and should be adjusted according to your vet's recommendation.
* **Size:**  Make sure the insects are appropriately sized for your frog.  Too large insects can pose a choking hazard.  The insect should ideally be no larger than the space between your frog's eyes.
* **Variety:**  Offer a variety of insects to ensure your frog gets a balanced diet.
* **Frequency:**  The feeding frequency depends on the frog's age and size.  Young frogs may need to be fed daily, while adults can be fed every other day or even less frequently. Observe your frog's weight and adjust feeding as needed.  An overweight frog needs its food reduced.  A thin frog needs a slight increase.
* **Water:**  Always provide fresh, clean water in a shallow dish.


**What NOT to feed:**

* Wild-caught insects:  These can carry parasites and pesticides.
* Foods other than insects:  White's Tree Frogs are strictly insectivores.


Always consult with a veterinarian specializing in amphibians if you have any concerns about your frog's diet or health. They can give you personalized advice based on your frog's specific needs.
