Horses' diets should primarily consist of **forage**, which includes:

* **Hay:**  This is the cornerstone of a horse's diet.  Different types of hay (timothy, orchard grass, alfalfa) offer varying nutritional profiles.  Alfalfa is higher in protein and calcium than timothy. The quality of the hay is crucial â€“ it should be green, leafy, and free of mold or dust.

* **Pasture:**  Access to good-quality pasture is ideal, providing essential nutrients and exercise.  However, the type and quantity of pasture available needs to be managed to prevent overgrazing and potential health problems.

In addition to forage, horses may need **supplements**, depending on their age, workload, and overall health. These might include:

* **Grain:**  This is typically used as a supplemental feed source, especially for working horses or those with higher energy requirements.  Examples include oats, corn, barley, and specialized commercial feeds.  Grain should be fed in moderation to avoid obesity and metabolic issues.

* **Concentrates:** These are commercially manufactured feeds designed to meet specific nutritional needs. They can be useful for horses with particular dietary requirements or those recovering from illness.

* **Mineral and Vitamin Supplements:** These are sometimes necessary to ensure the horse receives all essential nutrients, particularly if the forage is deficient.  It's important to consult a veterinarian before adding supplements to a horse's diet.


**Things to Avoid:**

* **Moldy or dusty hay:** This can cause respiratory problems.
* **Spoiled grain:** Can lead to digestive upset and other health issues.
* **Certain plants:** Some plants are toxic to horses and should be avoided in pastures.
* **Human food:** Many foods humans eat are toxic to horses.  Chocolate, onions, and apples seeds, for example, should never be given to horses.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Age:** Foals, yearlings, and older horses have different nutritional needs.
* **Breed:** Different breeds may have different energy requirements.
* **Activity level:** Working horses require more energy than those kept as pets.
* **Body condition:**  Maintaining a healthy body condition is vital. A veterinarian or equine nutritionist can help determine the appropriate amount and type of feed.
* **Dental health:**  Horses need regular dental care to ensure they can chew their food properly.

It's crucial to work with a veterinarian or equine nutritionist to develop a tailored feeding plan for your horse to ensure they receive optimal nutrition and remain healthy.  Don't rely solely on general advice; individual needs vary greatly.
