Ferrets are carnivores, and their diet should reflect that.  Avoid anything with fillers or grains.  High-quality ferret food should be the cornerstone of their diet.

**Commercial Ferret Food:**

* **Look for foods with:**  Named meat sources (chicken, turkey, rabbit, etc.) listed as the first few ingredients.  High meat protein content (at least 30-40%), moderate fat content (18-30%), and low fiber. Avoid foods with corn, wheat, soy, and other fillers.
* **High-quality brands:**  Research brands known for good quality ingredients and avoid budget brands that might use cheaper, less nutritious fillers.  Ask your vet or experienced ferret owners for recommendations in your area.
* **Variety:** While a primary food is essential, you can occasionally offer different flavors of the same high-quality brand to prevent boredom.

**Meat-Based Treats (in moderation):**

* **Raw or cooked meat:** Small amounts of cooked meat (chicken, turkey, rabbit) can be offered as occasional treats.  Raw meat carries a risk of bacterial contamination, so be cautious and ensure it's extremely fresh.
* **Meat baby food:**  Plain meat baby food (chicken, turkey, or beef) can be a useful tool for medication administration or as a small treat.  Avoid those with added vegetables or seasonings.

**Things to AVOID:**

* **Dog or cat food:** These are formulated for different digestive systems and nutritional needs.
* **Sweet treats:** Ferrets are prone to diabetes.  Avoid sugary foods entirely.
* **Dairy products:** Many ferrets are lactose intolerant.
* **Grains:** Corn, wheat, and soy are poor sources of nutrition for ferrets.
* **Bones:** Cooked bones can splinter and cause serious injury.  Raw bones are a choking hazard and can carry bacteria.
* **Chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, avocado, caffeine, alcohol:** These are all toxic to ferrets.
* **Vegetables and fruits:** While some tiny amounts might be accepted, they are not essential and shouldn't be a regular part of their diet.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide fresh, clean water.
* **Portion control:** Overfeeding can lead to obesity, which is a serious health concern for ferrets.  Follow feeding guidelines on your chosen food.
* **Consult your veterinarian:**  They can provide personalized dietary advice based on your ferret's age, health, and activity level.
