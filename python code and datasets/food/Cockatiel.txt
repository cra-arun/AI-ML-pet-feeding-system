Cockatiels need a varied diet to thrive.  A good mix of seeds, pellets, fruits, and vegetables is essential.  Here's a breakdown:

**Essential Components:**

* **High-Quality Pellets (70-80% of their diet):**  These are crucial for providing a balanced nutritional foundation.  Look for pellets specifically formulated for cockatiels, with a low percentage of seeds.  Avoid "cockatiel mixes" which are often heavily seed-based and can lead to nutritional imbalances.  Brands like Harrison's, Roudybush, and Zupreem are popular choices.

* **Seeds (10-20% of their diet):**  While seeds should only be a small part of their diet, they can be offered as treats.  Offer a small amount of a variety like canary seed, millet spray, and sunflower seeds (in moderation due to high fat content).

**Fruits and Vegetables (10-20% of their diet):** Offer a variety daily.  Wash thoroughly before serving.  Examples include:

* **Fruits:** Apple (remove seeds), banana (in moderation), berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), melon (cantaloupe, honeydew), mango, pear.
* **Vegetables:** Broccoli florets, carrots (shredded or sliced), cooked sweet potato, green beans (cooked or raw), kale, peas, spinach (in moderation due to oxalic acid).

**Other Important Considerations:**

* **Treats:**  Small amounts of cooked whole grains (brown rice, quinoa), unsalted nuts (almonds, walnuts â€“ in moderation), and cooked pasta can be given occasionally as treats.
* **Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a bowl or water bottle.
* **Calcium:** Cuttlebone or mineral blocks should be readily available to help them meet their calcium needs.
* **Avoid:** Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, salt, and anything processed or sugary.  Also avoid foods that are toxic to birds, such as onions and garlic.
* **Portion Control:**  Avoid overfeeding, especially with seeds and high-fat treats.  A cockatiel's daily food intake should be around 1-2 tablespoons total.
* **Gradual Introduction:** When introducing new foods, do so gradually to avoid digestive upset.

**Important Note:** Consult with an avian veterinarian for specific dietary recommendations for your cockatiel, especially if they have any health concerns. They can provide guidance on the appropriate portion sizes and food types based on your bird's age, size, and activity level.
