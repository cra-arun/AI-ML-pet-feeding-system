Leopard geckos are insectivores, meaning their diet should consist primarily of insects.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed them:

**Primary Food Sources:**

* **Crickets:** These are a staple and readily available.  Choose appropriately sized crickets; they shouldn't be larger than the gecko's head.
* **Dubia roaches:** A popular alternative to crickets, dubia roaches are considered cleaner and easier to gut-load (see below). They also don't climb smooth surfaces as easily as crickets, reducing escape risks.
* **Mealworms:** Offer these as an occasional treat, not a staple food, as they are higher in fat.  Avoid feeding large mealworms, as they can be difficult to digest.
* **Waxworms:** Similar to mealworms, these should only be given as very occasional treats due to their high fat content.  Too many can lead to obesity and health problems.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut-loading:**  Before feeding insects to your gecko, you need to "gut-load" them. This means feeding the insects nutritious food for 24-48 hours before offering them to your gecko.  Good gut-load options include high-quality commercial insect food, vegetables (like carrots, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens), and fruits (in moderation).  A well-gut-loaded insect provides your gecko with essential vitamins and minerals.

* **Dusting:**  After gut-loading, lightly dust the insects with a high-quality calcium and vitamin D3 supplement. This is crucial for proper bone growth and overall health.  Use a separate supplement with calcium only a couple of times a week.  Don't overdo it, as excessive vitamin D3 can be harmful.

* **Size:**  Insects should be appropriately sized for your gecko.  Too large insects can be difficult to digest and potentially injure the gecko.

* **Frequency:**  The frequency of feeding depends on the age and size of your gecko.  Juveniles (under 1 year old) should be fed daily or every other day.  Adults can be fed every 2-3 days, or even less frequently if they're not very hungry. Always monitor your gecko's weight to ensure they are maintaining a healthy body condition.  An overweight gecko is as unhealthy as an underweight one.

* **Variety:**  While crickets and dubia roaches are great staples, offering a variety of insects ensures a more balanced diet.

* **Never feed your leopard gecko:** wild-caught insects (risk of parasites and pesticides), large insects (risk of impaction), or anything other than insects (they are insectivores).

* **Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a shallow dish.

If you're unsure about any aspect of your leopard gecko's diet, consult with a reptile veterinarian or experienced leopard gecko breeder. They can provide personalized advice based on your gecko's specific needs.
