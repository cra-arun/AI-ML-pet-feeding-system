Cockatoos have very specific dietary needs and require a varied diet to thrive.  A diet consisting solely of seeds is inadequate and can lead to serious health problems.  Their food should consist of a good balance of:

**1. Pellets:**  These should form the *base* of their diet (around 60-70%).  Look for high-quality, formulated pellets specifically designed for cockatoos.  These pellets provide a balanced mix of nutrients they need.  Avoid generic "birdseed" mixes.

**2. Fresh Fruits and Vegetables:** This should make up a significant portion of their diet (around 20-30%).  Offer a variety to ensure a wide range of vitamins and minerals.  Good choices include:

* **Fruits:** Apples (remove seeds), berries (in moderation due to sugar content), bananas (in moderation), mangoes, papaya, pears, kiwi.
* **Vegetables:** Broccoli, carrots, corn (on the cob is fun for them to chew), peas, green beans, sweet potatoes, zucchini.

**Important Note on Fruits and Vegetables:**  Always wash thoroughly before serving.  Some fruits and vegetables are toxic to birds, so research carefully before introducing anything new.

**3. Healthy Fats and Proteins (in moderation):**

* **Nuts:**  Small amounts of unsalted, unroasted nuts like almonds, walnuts, and macadamia nuts (in moderation due to high fat content).  Avoid peanuts, which are legumes, not nuts, and can be a choking hazard.
* **Seeds:**  Offered sparingly as treats, not a staple. Sunflower seeds are high in fat, so limit them.
* **Cooked lean meats:**  Small amounts of cooked chicken or turkey (without added salt or seasoning) can be offered occasionally.  Hard-boiled eggs are also acceptable, but sparingly.

**4. Foraging Opportunities:**

* **Foraging toys:**  These help stimulate natural behaviors and prevent boredom.  You can stuff pellets into toys, hide food in puzzle feeders, or create your own foraging opportunities.


**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Avocado:** Toxic to birds.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to birds.
* **Caffeine:** Toxic to birds.
* **Alcohol:** Toxic to birds.
* **Salt:** Harmful in large quantities.
* **Processed foods:**  Avoid anything sugary, salty, or heavily processed.
* **Rhubarb:** Toxic to birds.
* **Onions, garlic, chives:** Toxic to birds.

**Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water daily.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Introduce new foods gradually:** To monitor for any adverse reactions.
* **Variety is key:** A diverse diet ensures your cockatoo receives all the necessary nutrients.
* **Portion control:** Overfeeding can lead to obesity.
* **Consult an avian veterinarian:** They can provide personalized dietary advice based on your cockatoo's age, breed, and health status.
