Hamsters need a varied diet to thrive.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed your hamster, and what to avoid:

**What to Feed Your Hamster:**

* **Hamster Food Mix:** This should form the base of their diet (about 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon per day, depending on size and age). Look for a high-quality mix that contains a variety of seeds, grains, nuts, and pellets. Avoid mixes with too many sugary treats.  Check the ingredients list â€“ seeds should make up a significant portion.

* **Fresh Fruits and Vegetables:** Offer small amounts (a tiny piece about the size of your pinky nail) daily.  Good options include:
    * **Vegetables:** Broccoli florets, carrots (in small quantities), cucumber, spinach (in moderation), green beans.
    * **Fruits:**  Small pieces of apple (remove seeds), banana (in moderation), berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries).  Always remove uneaten portions after a few hours to prevent spoilage.

* **Protein:**  Occasionally offer a tiny amount of plain, cooked chicken or hard-boiled egg (remove shell) as a treat.  Never give raw meat.

* **Healthy Treats (in moderation):** Small amounts of plain, unsalted nuts (like almonds or walnuts, shelled), a small piece of sunflower seed (high in fat, so limit), a tiny piece of dried fruit (unsweetened).

**What NOT to Feed Your Hamster:**

* **Chocolate:** Toxic to hamsters.
* **Candy and Sweets:**  High sugar content is very unhealthy.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to hamsters.
* **Alcohol:** Obviously toxic.
* **Salty Foods:**  Avoid anything salty, including processed foods, chips, etc.
* **Dairy Products:** Hamsters are lactose intolerant.
* **Raw Meat:**  Risk of bacterial contamination.
* **Onion and Garlic:** Toxic to hamsters.
* **Citrus Fruits (large amounts):**  Can cause digestive upset.
* **Potatoes (raw):** Contains solanine, which is toxic.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a sipper bottle or a heavy, shallow bowl that cannot be easily tipped over.
* **Portion Control:**  Overfeeding leads to obesity and health problems.  Follow the feeding guidelines on your hamster food mix and offer small amounts of fresh food.
* **Variety:** A varied diet ensures your hamster gets all the necessary nutrients.
* **Cleanliness:** Remove any uneaten food and spoiled fresh produce daily to prevent bacterial growth.


If you are unsure about a particular food, it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid it.  Consult with a veterinarian or an experienced hamster owner if you have any questions about your hamster's diet.
