Mice need a varied diet to stay healthy and happy.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed your pet mice, and what to avoid:

**Essential Components:**

* **High-quality commercial mouse food:** This should form the base of their diet (around 60-70%). Look for a mix that contains a variety of ingredients, including grains, seeds, and pellets. Avoid mixes with too many fillers or artificial colors and flavors.  Look for a mix specifically formulated for mice, not rats or hamsters.

* **Fresh Vegetables and Fruits:** These should make up a smaller portion of their diet (around 10-20%).  Offer small amounts of fresh, washed vegetables and fruits daily.  Good options include:
    * **Vegetables:** Broccoli florets, carrots (small pieces), cucumber, green beans, spinach (in moderation), bell peppers.
    * **Fruits:**  Small pieces of apple, banana, berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries).

* **Protein:**  A tiny amount of protein is beneficial, but don't overdo it.  Occasional small pieces of cooked chicken or hard-boiled egg are suitable.

**Treats (in moderation):**

* Small pieces of whole-wheat bread or crackers.
* A tiny amount of cooked pasta.

**What to AVOID:**

* **Chocolate:** Toxic to mice.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to mice.
* **Onions and garlic:** Toxic to mice.
* **Raw beans:** Can cause digestive problems.
* **Large seeds:**  Sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds should be offered sparingly due to high fat content.
* **Sugary foods:**  Can lead to health problems.
* **Anything salty or processed:**  Harmful to their delicate systems.
* **Dairy products:** Mice are lactose intolerant.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a sipper bottle or a heavy, shallow dish.
* **Portion control:**  Mice have small stomachs.  Overfeeding can lead to obesity and health problems.  Offer small amounts of food throughout the day rather than one large meal.
* **Variety:** Offer a variety of foods to ensure your mice are getting a balanced diet.
* **Observe your mice:**  Pay attention to what your mice seem to enjoy and adjust their diet accordingly. If you notice any changes in their eating habits or stool, consult a veterinarian.


Always consult with a veterinarian or a knowledgeable pet store employee if you have any questions about your mouse's diet.  They can provide personalized advice based on your mouse's age, breed, and health.
