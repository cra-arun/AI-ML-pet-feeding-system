Crested geckos are primarily insectivores, but their diet in captivity often includes a commercially prepared powdered diet as a staple.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed them:

**Primary Food Source (staple):**

* **Commercial Crested Gecko Diet:** This is crucial.  Reputable brands like Pangea, Repashy, and Josh's Frogs offer complete diets formulated specifically for crested geckos. These powders are mixed with water to create a paste.  This should make up the majority (60-80%) of their diet.  **Do not solely rely on insects.**

**Supplementary Food (occasional treats, not a staple):**

* **Insects:**  These should be offered sparingly, approximately 1-3 times per week, and only as a supplement to the commercial diet.  Good options include:
    * **Crickets:** Small to medium size.  Gut-load them (feed them nutritious food) before offering them to your gecko.
    * **Dubia Roaches:** A cleaner and easier to manage insect than crickets. Gut-load them as well.
    * **Mealworms:** Offer sparingly as they are high in fat.
    * **Waxworms:**  Extremely high in fat; only offer as VERY occasional treats.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Gut-loading:**  This means feeding the insects a nutritious diet before feeding them to your gecko. This ensures the insects provide additional nutrients to your gecko.  Good gut-load foods include high-quality commercial insect food, fruits, and vegetables.
* **Dusting:** Lightly dust insects with a calcium and vitamin D3 supplement.  Do this regularly, but don't overdo it as excess calcium can be harmful.  Follow the instructions on the supplement packaging.
* **Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a shallow dish.
* **Variety:** While a commercial diet is the staple, providing occasional insects adds variety and enrichment.
* **Age:**  Very young geckos may need more frequent feeding.  Adjust the frequency based on your gecko's growth and activity levels.  Observe your gecko for signs of being overweight or underweight to adjust feeding accordingly.
* **Quantity:**  The amount of food should be appropriate for the size of your gecko.  Start with a small amount and adjust based on how much your gecko eats in a given feeding.  Leftover food should be removed to prevent mold and bacterial growth.

**What NOT to feed:**

* **Fruits and vegetables:** While some people will report their geckos eating these, they are not a necessary part of their diet and should not be fed regularly.  Their digestive system is not designed for this.
* **Large insects:** These can pose a choking hazard.


Always consult a veterinarian specializing in reptiles if you have any concerns about your crested gecko's diet or health.  They can provide personalized advice based on your gecko's specific needs.
