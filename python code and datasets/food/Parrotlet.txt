Parrotlets need a varied diet to thrive.  A good diet consists of:

* **High-quality pellet food:** This should form the base of their diet (about 50-60%). Look for a pellet mix specifically formulated for small parrots or parrotlets.  Avoid mixes with too many seeds, as they are high in fat and can lead to obesity and nutritional imbalances.  Good brands will list specific vitamins and minerals.

* **Fresh fruits and vegetables (30-40%):**  Offer a variety daily, including:
    * **Fruits:** Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries), apple (remove seeds), banana (in moderation), mango, papaya, melon (small pieces).
    * **Vegetables:**  Carrots, peas (shelled), spinach (in moderation), broccoli florets, bell peppers (small pieces), zucchini.  Avoid avocado which is toxic to birds.

* **Sprouts:**  These are a great source of nutrients and are highly digestible.  Sprout seeds like alfalfa, mung beans, or lentils.

* **Small amounts of seeds (10% or less):**  Seeds should be a treat, not a staple.  Offer a small amount of millet spray occasionally.

* **Occasional treats:**  Cooked quinoa, brown rice (in moderation), a tiny bit of unsalted, cooked pasta.  **Never give chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, or avocado.**

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water daily.
* **Variety:** Offer a diverse selection of fruits and vegetables to ensure a balanced diet.
* **Portion Size:**  Parrotlets are tiny and prone to obesity.  Give small portions throughout the day rather than one large meal.
* **Food Safety:**  Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before serving.
* **Introduction of new foods:** Introduce new foods gradually to observe for any allergic reactions.
* **Cut food into small pieces:**  Parrotlets have small beaks and need food thatâ€™s easy to manage.


It's always a good idea to consult with an avian veterinarian to create a customized diet plan for your parrotlet, especially if they have any health concerns.  They can help you determine the best food choices and portion sizes for your individual bird.
