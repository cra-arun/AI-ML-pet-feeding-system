Green iguanas are herbivores, and their diet should primarily consist of dark, leafy greens.  A varied diet is crucial for their health and well-being.  Here's a breakdown of what to feed them, and what to avoid:

**Good Foods (The bulk of their diet should consist of these):**

* **Dark, leafy greens:** These are the cornerstone of a green iguana's diet.  Excellent choices include:
    * Collard greens
    * Mustard greens
    * Turnip greens
    * Dandelion greens
    * Beet greens
    * Swiss chard (in moderation due to oxalates)
    * Hibiscus flowers
* **Other Vegetables:**
    * Bell peppers (especially red and orange)
    * Squash (butternut, acorn, etc.)
    * Carrots (in moderation)
    * Green beans
    * Zucchini
    * Mango (in moderation)
    * Papaya (in moderation)
* **Fruits (only as occasional treats, in small amounts):**
    * Mango
    * Papaya
    * Figs
    * Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
    * Banana (very occasionally, due to high sugar content)

**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Meat and animal products:** Iguanas are strictly herbivores.  No insects, meat, or dairy.
* **Processed foods:** Absolutely no processed foods like chips, cookies, bread, etc.
* **High-oxalate vegetables:** While some greens like Swiss chard are okay in moderation, avoid excessively high-oxalate foods like spinach, rhubarb, and beet greens in large quantities, as these can interfere with calcium absorption.
* **Avocado:** Toxic to iguanas.
* **Onions and garlic:** Toxic to iguanas.
* **Chocolate:** Toxic to iguanas.
* **Anything with added sugar or salt:** These can be seriously detrimental to their health.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Calcium and Vitamin D3 supplementation:**  Iguanas need supplemental calcium and Vitamin D3, particularly when they are young and growing.  Your veterinarian can advise on appropriate supplementation.  Dusting their food with a calcium powder (without phosphorus) is typically recommended.
* **Variety:** Offer a wide variety of the approved foods to ensure a balanced diet.  Don't feed the same thing every day.
* **Cleanliness:** Always wash all vegetables thoroughly before feeding them to your iguana.
* **Portion sizes:**  Feed your iguana several times a day, adjusting the portions to its size and age.  They should never be overfed.
* **Water:** Always provide fresh, clean water in a large, shallow bowl.


**Consult your veterinarian:** Before making any significant changes to your iguana's diet, it's always best to consult with a veterinarian experienced in reptile care. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your iguana's age, size, and health.
