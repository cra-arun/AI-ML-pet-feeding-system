Prairie dogs are herbivores, and their diet in the wild is primarily composed of grasses, forbs (flowering plants), and other vegetation.  However, as pets, their diet needs careful consideration to ensure they receive all the necessary nutrients.  Don't ever feed them foods intended for humans.

**Here's a breakdown of what to feed your prairie dog and what to avoid:**

**Good Foods:**

* **Timothy Hay:** This should form the bulk (70-80%) of their diet.  It's crucial for their digestive health and provides essential fiber.  Avoid alfalfa hay, as it's too rich for adult prairie dogs.  Orchard grass is a suitable alternative.

* **Commercial Prairie Dog Pellets:** Look for high-quality pellets specifically formulated for prairie dogs.  These should be a smaller portion of their diet (10-15%).  Read the ingredient list carefully; Timothy hay should be the primary ingredient.

* **Fresh Vegetables (small amounts):** Offer a variety of fresh vegetables in moderation (10-15%). Good options include:
    * Dark leafy greens (e.g., romaine lettuce, kale, spinach – in moderation due to oxalates)
    * Broccoli florets
    * Carrots (in small amounts – high in sugar)
    * Bell peppers (in small amounts)
    * Cucumber
    * Green beans
    * Squash (e.g., butternut, acorn)


* **Fruits (very small amounts as occasional treats):**  Offer only tiny amounts of fruits as an occasional treat.  Too much sugar can be harmful.  Good options include:
    * Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
    * Apple slices (without seeds)
    * Banana slices (very small amount)

* **Prairie Dog-safe Forbs and Grasses (if supervised):** If you have access to safe, untreated plants identified as safe for prairie dogs, you can offer small amounts.  **Never** let them forage independently as this poses extreme risk of poisonous plants.

**Foods to AVOID:**

* **Alfalfa Hay:** Too high in calcium and protein for adult prairie dogs.
* **Seeds and nuts:** High in fat and can lead to obesity and other health problems.
* **Treats intended for other animals:** These are usually inappropriate for prairie dog digestive systems and nutritional needs.
* **Meat and dairy products:** Prairie dogs are herbivores and these foods aren't part of their natural diet.
* **Chocolate, caffeine, alcohol:** These are toxic to prairie dogs.
* **Avocado:** Contains persin, which is toxic to prairie dogs.
* **Rhubarb:** Contains oxalates, which are harmful.
* **Potatoes:** Contain solanine, which can be toxic.
* **Onions and Garlic:** These are toxic to prairie dogs.
* **Anything Processed or Sugary:**  This includes bread, candy, etc.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Fresh water:** Always provide access to clean, fresh water.
* **Gradual changes:** Introduce new foods gradually to avoid digestive upset.
* **Variety:** Offer a variety of safe foods to ensure a balanced diet.
* **Observation:** Watch your prairie dog for signs of digestive issues or allergies.
* **Veterinary guidance:** Consult with an exotic animal veterinarian for personalized dietary advice.  They can help you create a diet tailored to your prairie dog's age, health, and specific needs.


Remember that improperly feeding a prairie dog can lead to serious health problems.  Prioritizing high-quality timothy hay, appropriate pellets, and small amounts of fresh vegetables and fruits is key to keeping your prairie dog happy and healthy.
